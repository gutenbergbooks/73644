<h3 title="Section 1">I</h3>

<p class="firstpara">Midway between Asia and Africa lies the giant peninsula
of Arabia&mdash;the vast, immutable, resplendently mysterious
country that bridges the Orient and the Occident.
Shaped somewhat like a triangle and somewhat
like an oblong, she appears to the vulgar eye more like
a boot with its toe lopped off. Three bodies of water&mdash;the
Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, and the Persian
Gulf&mdash;roll their guardian waves against her rocky,
mountainous coasts, while her northern domain is
staunchly defended by the impassable Syrian Desert.</p>

<p>Perhaps no other country, not even Switzerland, has
been so well protected by nature against the assaults&mdash;military,
economic or religious&mdash;of the outside world.
Before the seventh century, the fury of the Roman
legions and the enthusiasm of martial Christians had
been expended in prodigious but wholly futile efforts
to subjugate her: the one because its soldiers died of
heat and thirst in her almost uninhabitable interior, and
the other because its votaries too often restricted their
religious zeal to a general consumption of alcohol and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span>
to an individual union with more than one wife or concubine.
But in any case, inasmuch as the Arabs were
fierce and warlike by nature, and were acquainted with
such refinements of wine and concupiscence as even the
most aspiring Christians had not achieved, the attacks
of Pagan Rome and Christian Palestine would probably
have come to naught. Even to this day, indeed, Arabia
has been left almost entirely alone by the outside world.
Timeless, changeless and unromantic save to the capricious
imagination of poets and travelers, her interminable,
ocean-like billows of arid sand have saved
her from all conquests. As she was in the dim and remote
beginnings of history, so she largely remains; and
the modern wanderer who penetrates her obscure interior
cannot be certain whether he will be greeted with
affluent hospitality or a frowning hostility that may
prove inimical to life itself.</p>

<p>A land of contrasts! Three-fourths surrounded by
water, her extensive interior is a scorched and stony desert;
her verdant southern coasts are soon lost in a lifeless
and almost level plateau; her abundantly fertile
province of Yemen, known to romance as Araby the
Blest, fades northward into the ominous wastes of
Nejd, or Arabia Deserta, and northwestward into the
precipitous wilds of Hejaz, or Arabia Petræa. Short
rivers hurl their jagged torrents down her sloping sides,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[p. 11]</span>
while prolific oases, always placid and unruffled, dot
her deserts. The fragrant breezes that come from the
Indian Ocean are quickly assimilated into the stagnant,
oppressive atmosphere of her centre; her palmy springs
may teem with sweet and pure waters, or with saline,
sulphurous scum. The broiling rays of the midday sun
give way nightly to bitter and frosty dews; her long-slumbering
sands are at times whirled violently aloft by
sharp, sudden, blinding storms that often overwhelm
caravans and tents, to subside as suddenly, leaving her
surface forever different&mdash;and yet forever the same. A
land untouched by time, where time’s oppression is yet
most powerfully felt; a land that never alters, though
perpetually subject to alteration; a land where the new
is eternally old, and the old is eternally new.</p>

<p>Nor does the paradox confine itself to her terrain;
her inhabitants and their social institutions, particularly
during the seventh century, exhibited corresponding
discrepancies. Although all Arabs were ruled by nearly
identical codes of honor, morals and manners, spoke a
generic tongue, and were passionately patriotic, they
were yet divided into tribes that bowed before countless
fetishes, conversed in individual dialects, and were
ever ready to fight to the death for the supremacy of
their particular clan. At times of national danger, it
is true, they fervently abandoned all local prejudices in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[p. 12]</span>
a tumultuous display of chauvinism; but such contingencies
were rare and, since the vague, immemorial inception
of her history, Arabian tribes, on the slightest
pretext or on no pretext at all, had frequently plunged
with limitless enthusiasm into the gratifying job of
slitting fraternal throats. All these various tribes,
moreover, were grouped into two fairly distinct divisions:
the city-dwellers and the Bedouins.</p>

<p>From her earliest days, Arabia had depended on
caravan trade for her subsistence. In the times of
Abraham, Moses and Solomon, her traders had carried
the fragrant spices and other products of Palestine and
Arabia&mdash;cassia, cinnamon, frankincense, myrrh, gums,
leather and coffee&mdash;into Egypt; and, conversely, the
“Kings of Arabia” had also freighted into Judea and
their own beloved land the priceless rarities of the Orient:
ivory, ebony and precious gems. For the dangers
of ocean commerce made a land route absolutely essential
for the exchange of merchandise between the East
and the West, and Arabia alone supplied the necessary
bridge for this extensive barter. Caravans from every
nation, therefore, had for centuries passed each other
on her sere surface; her oases had thus become cynosures
where rest and refreshment could be had; and so by degrees
these centres of repose became the sites where
marts, temples and sanctuaries sprang indiscriminately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[p. 13]</span>
up. These nuclei of elementary civilizations led, little
by little, to the development of an urban population
where those Arabs who chanced to be disposed toward
peace and business could lead a moderately serene life.
But the instinct of nomadism was incalculably strong
in most of Arabia’s sons, and myriads of men, yielding
to the powerful atavistic impulse, gladly relinquished
the relatively soft environment of urbanism in order to
undergo, with fatalistic indifference, the hazards of a
roaming, marauding, desert life.</p>

<p>These Bedouins, “dwellers in the open land” or “people
of the tent,” were at once independent and servile,
patriotic and anarchistic, friendly and hostile, thievish
and chivalric. A contemptuous impatience of restraints
and bonds of any kind made each one of them
look upon himself as a king; at the same time each one
willingly bowed the knee to the precepts of the most
powerful ruler, or sheik, who, through the prestige of inherent
or acquired power, automatically guided the
shifting destinies of each clan. Their strongest institution
was the blood-feud&mdash;quickly abandoned, to be sure,
when a common enemy appeared on the horizon&mdash;and
tribal warfare or personal strife was an every-day affair;
nevertheless, the centralizing power arising from
perpetual traditions of a mutual fraternalism of interests
held these roving hordes in an elastic coalescence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[p. 14]</span>
The stranger who sought the hospitality of their tents
might be greeted by a flashing scimitar or a handclasp
and a hearty dinner&mdash;he could never tell which fate
would be his, except by experiment. If he were successful,
he was naturally pleased; whereas, if he failed,
his opinion and his life were soon of no moment to anyone
save the Bedouins who took his booty. Equally
sensitive to insults or compliments, they guarded above
all else the honor of their beards and their women: to
shake the one was to invite immediate death, and to cast
the smallest aspersion on the other was to embrace a
corresponding doom. And still, despite the obeisance
paid to women, the birth of a daughter was looked upon
as a horrible misfortune. The burial alive of female
infants was a common custom, and the natural death
of one brought hearty congratulations to the fortunate
parents; while such girls as managed to remain alive until
their seventh or eighth year were summarily disposed
of at that tender age to the first suitor who appeared.
Women, in brief, were mere chattel: the eldest son commonly
inherited his father’s wives as a logical and desirable
portion of the parental estate.</p>

<p>Their livelihood was won principally by the robbing
of caravans. The plundering of them, in fact, was
justly held by the Bedouins to be merely a righteous
method of exacting the customs that were levied everywhere;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[p. 15]</span>
for the land, they maintained, was exclusively
theirs by right of domain, and trespassers thereon must
pay an appropriate penalty. Mounted upon their swift
and spirited horses, sprung from the purest pedigree
through many generations of careful selection and
trained to respond instantly to the slightest touch of
the rein, the Bedouins rarely failed to overtake their
fleeing prey. Since the loot of caravans supplied them
with all the necessities of life, they naturally worshiped
their horses and camels&mdash;in particular the ones they
had stolen&mdash;with a superstitious reverence. Their
dromedaries, indeed, offered an escape from every contingency:
they furnished transportation, food (both
tender flesh and milk), long hair for tent-building, and,
in case of a pinch, the water in their capacious reservoirs
could be used for drink and their dung for fuel.
The supreme height of generosity for a Bedouin was attained
on those very rare occasions when he slaughtered
his own cherished camel to feed and warm the stranger
of a night.</p>

<p>In some respects the most striking and potent social
institution among the Arabs, urbanites and nomads
alike, was the annual fair. Every year, during certain
months that were supposed to be inviolably sacred&mdash;so
sacred, in fact, that even personal and tribal broils were
taboo&mdash;a series of pageants was held throughout the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p. 16]</span>
whole country; but the most populous and successful of
them all was celebrated at Ukaz, near Mecca. To that
place came Arabia’s best and fairest: opulent merchants,
actors garbed in masks or veils, poets of the desert, sheiks
notorious for their proficiency in war and love, dancing
girls, and maidens whose alluring sensuousness was
subtly dissembled in languorous modesty, met on a common
footing. Specimens of trade and primitive art
abounded in many booths; the violent contortions of the
corybantes, as they whirled dizzily from tent to tent,
excited the reckless Bedouins to such a pitch that
drunken orgies occasionally followed, during which the
sacred season was momentarily forgotten and resolutions
of peace and chastity conveniently overlooked.
The pious devotions of pilgrims, the piteous moans of
beggars for alms, and the quiet exchange of talk between
traders, sightseers and friends, was often disturbed
by hilarious shrieks of applause for the bacchantes,
by the clang of the cymbal, and the clash of the
scimitar. If shrines for prayer were open all day, gambling
houses did a flourishing business at night; and if
poetic and histrionic contests delighted the onlookers,
unfortunate results frequently followed. For the
poets, chanting a rudely rhythmical verse, incontinently
boasted their individual excellence in the manufacture
of stanzas; and not seldom did they caustically satirize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[p. 17]</span>
the members of some other clan, meanwhile boundlessly
extolling the bravery of their own warriors and the
surpassing beauty and chastity of their women. All
this bloated braggadocio paved the way to feuds between
different tribes, and thus the fairs, which were supposed
to allay hatreds and inculcate friendships, often led to
results that were precisely opposite. Thus, for weeks
and even months, the glittering, gorgeously colored
spectacle went on&mdash;a dazzling drama that, in its violent
contrasts of mystical adoration and wanton lechery, of
humility and gross egotism, of entrancing beauty and
fetid squalor, furnishes perhaps the best clue to the complex
and divergent character of Arabia’s children.</p>

<p>Her religion was an all-pervading form of indigenous
and manifold idolatry, tinctured with faint traces of
Judaism and Christianity. The worship of the stars,
that furnished a nightly quota of detached beauty and&mdash;what
was more important&mdash;utility as a never-failing
compass, is easily understandable; but just why she
should have reverenced the blazing tropical sun and the
tons upon tons of stones that were sprinkled over her
parched surface, tempts to a metaphysical speculation
which&mdash;as certain learned dissertations prove&mdash;is more
fascinating than illuminating. Perhaps the most original
and poetic element in this idol-worship was a vague
belief in the Jinn: those vast, inchoate, awe-inspiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[p. 18]</span>
creatures, now friendly and now inimical, that&mdash;so every
devout Arab believed&mdash;brooded like gigantic birds in
the illimitable heavens that canopied Arabia. Judaism
had made some effort to proselytize the Arabs, but had
wisely given up the attempt after it realized what fascinating
opportunities existed for the profits of trade.
Christian Abyssinia, too, had manifested a laudable desire
to turn her Pagan neighbor to the right way; but
proud and impetuous Arabs were not particularly susceptible
to the pleas of negroes, even though they
chanced to be Christian negroes; and besides, the dialectical
hair-splittings which so enthralled the followers
of Arius and Athanasius could hardly be expected to
offer much interest to minds that unfortunately had
never been given an opportunity to become enraptured
by the intricate charms of theology. But, in common
with the devotees of Moses and Christ, the Arabs exalted
ancestor-worship, and they even claimed, with a
faith as touching as it was irrelevant, that Abraham
himself was one of their most distinguished forefathers.</p>

<p>Here, then, was a land of marvelous opportunity for
the right man. Ruled by rigid taboos and certain patriarchs
of exceptional prowess, yet actually without a
ruler; devoutly religious as religion goes, yet without a
unifying religion; containing an enormous amount of
military valor, yet wasting her strength in inter-tribal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[p. 19]</span>
battles&mdash;Arabia, in the seventh century, stood in dire
dearth of some commanding personality. The consecutive
dominions of Egypt, Assyria, Persia and
Greece&mdash;nations that had once been supreme in regal
splendor&mdash;had disintegrated in rapid succession; and
Rome, the mightiest of them all, was now nearing her
eclipse. Neither Syria nor Persia was of much account
any longer, Africa was weak, the Christians had
forgotten Christ in their absorption in the more thrilling
pursuit of schismatic squabbling, and the Jews too
often bartered their sacred phylacteries for the products
of Pagan ingenuity. Meanwhile, during the kaleidoscopic
evolution and disruption of world-conquering
empires, Arabia had dragged out only a ghostly existence;
she was a nation that had either been carelessly
forgotten or contemptuously disregarded; she
had won no place in the sun. The general decadence
of nations and faiths at this time offered an unparallelled
chance to the mythical Arab who, by evolving a
religious and political system based upon the common
elements that formed the solid foundation of every
Arabian tribe, should fuse the emotional and economic
strength of the land into an indivisible unity, and&mdash;who
knew?&mdash;perhaps carry on the torch recently dropped
by the expiring Roman Empire. Now, as careful students
of history are well aware, great men, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[p. 20]</span>
warriors, statesmen or prophets, have a way of bobbing
up at the precise moment when they are most needed.
So it happened that, in the city of Mecca, probably in
August in the year 570, Mohammed, the Prophet of
Allah, was born.</p>


<h3 title="Section 2">II</h3>

<p>For centuries before the birth of the Prophet, Mecca
had been the most populous and influential city in
Arabia. She owed this eminence to two very different
things: to her geographical situation, and to some
pretty legends that sought to explain her divine origin.</p>

<p>In the first place, she occupied a convenient and
highly strategic position on a great caravan route.
She reposed in a natural amphitheatre, partially encompassed
by precipitous hills of quartz and granite;
touching her southern border lay the pleasant plains
of Yemen, while her northern edge was overhung by
the lowering rocks of Hejaz. The never-failing well,
Zemzem, that gushed from her centre furnished an apparently
inexhaustible supply of water for the passing
trains of merchandise; it became a refreshing stopping
place, and thus by degrees grew to be a focus
for commerce. Crowds of traders, coming principally
from Yemen, eventually located there and established
the beginnings of a mercantile business: they collected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[p. 21]</span>
the frontier customs, the hire for hauling produce, the
dues arising from protection, and, in addition, they
started various types of traffic among themselves.</p>

<p>Orthodox Arabs, however, prefer to explain her
superiority by giving more credit to her miraculous inception
than to dry economic matters. According to
them, when Hagar was expelled into the wilderness
she chanced in her wanderings to come into the vale
of Mecca. Both she and little Ishmael were almost
overcome with thirst, when the child accidentally kicked
the ground in a paroxysm of passion, and lo! a stream
of pure water bubbled forth from the spot struck by
his dainty toes. When Abraham heard of this miracle
he visited the place, and, aided by his dutiful son
Ishmael, now grown to manhood, built a sacred temple
and instituted definite rites of pilgrimage. Inasmuch
as the Arabs had mingled with the Hebrew race for
many generations on matters of business, it was perhaps
natural enough that they should have relied on
the Jews for a superior facility in poetical imagination
as well as a superior business credit.</p>

<p>Whichever explanation is more plausible, there is
no doubt that, even before the beginning of the
Christian era, Mecca was a well-established mercantile
city that included a sacred temple, the Kaba, which was
already a national centre of adoration. At some early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[p. 22]</span>
date there was instituted a carefully systematized, twofold
form of worship based upon well-tried Hebrew
models: the Lesser and Greater Pilgrimages. Devotees
who were able to satisfy their consciences by performing
the ritual of the Lesser Pilgrimage only, went
about it thus: they came to Mecca, generally during
the sacred month of Rejeb, feverishly kissed the blessed
Black Stone&mdash;the most divinely hallowed rock in a
country that reverenced every one of her millions of
stones&mdash;imbedded in the eastern corner of the Kaba,
sedately walked seven times around the saintly edifice,
and then marched in a more hasty manner seven times
to and fro between two spots near by, over a route
which Hagar was supposed to have trod. But the
Greater Pilgrimage demanded a more strenuous faith.
Those who elected to perform its stricter stipulations
could do so only during the month of Dhul-Hijja,
which was even more holy than Rejeb; and, besides accomplishing
the requirements already specified, they
were obliged to travel on foot to Arafat, a small hill
some twelve miles east of Mecca, and to struggle manfully
up its steep sides. Before entering the hallowed
territory of Mecca, the votaries of both pilgrimages
donned a special raiment, and, when all the religious
activities were completed, they shaved their heads and
pared their nails.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[p. 23]</span></p>

<p>Favored thus by nature and superstition, Mecca had
grown apace. For centuries different clans vied with
each other in an effort to gain control of her destiny&mdash;a
control that was eminently desirable, for by the fifth
century Mecca was <em>Mecca</em>, in the most modern sense
of the word. The dialect spoken by her citizens had
come to be regarded as the standard of purity by which
all other tribes were judged; and pilgrims from every
extraneous Arabian clan, except the untamable Bedouins,
came yearly to pay their vows and drink from
the sacred fount of Zemzem&mdash;whose waters were a
bit brackish, to be sure, but still satisfactorily sacred.
During that century a sect called the Koreish finally
won a foothold that gave every evidence of being
permanent. Despite occasional bickerings among
themselves as to matters of patronage and patriarchal
succession, they always agreed when an outside enemy
appeared; and successive victories over those who vainly
sought to supplant them led to their exaltation throughout
all Arabia.</p>

<p>Elated with the pride of successful conquest, the
Koreish were not slow to reap the fruits of power. Although
the sanctity of the holy city induced a general
atmosphere of peace, forays and brawls occasionally
took place, and the Koreish merchants therefore conceived
the scheme of wearing badges that kept them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[p. 24]</span>
moderately safe from assault. But measures of defence
soon gave way to offence: “Let us release ourselves
from some of the observances imposed upon the
multitude,” they said. So they solaced themselves by
undergoing the rites of the Lesser Pilgrimage only;
they refused to be restricted to the use of the plain
butter and cheese that formed the staple pilgrim diet;
they adopted the luxury of leathern tents instead of
those made from camel-hair. Finally, they formulated
stringent rules to be observed by all pilgrims except
themselves&mdash;rules that smack more of economic
pressure than unalloyed faith. All outsiders were forbidden
to bring food within the walls of Mecca, and
were forced to circumnavigate the Kaba entirely naked
or dressed in clothes that could be obtained only from
the Meccan merchants. In view of these facts, there
can be but little doubt that a prophet who would invent
and promulgate a more pure and magnanimous
faith was very desirable.</p>

<h3 title="Section 1">I</h3>

<p class="firstpara">Among the numberless misty matters that befog the
career of Mohammed is the moot question of his parentage.
The voice of Allah, speaking through the lips
of his Prophet in the Koran, proclaims that his best
beloved son was an orphan, poor and astray; but, while
a proper modesty may well make one hesitate to question
the smallest decree of such a transcendent authority,
one can still scarcely refrain from noting that most
boys who attain a position of unrivaled eminence in
later life are prone to give a suspicious amount of emphasis
to the hardships of their youth. Practically
everything that concerns the life of the Prophet is
flecked with more or less obscurity&mdash;an obscurity that
has been intensified by both his friends and his foes.
Almost all the Christian commentators have dwelt lovingly
upon the worst elements in the life and teachings
of Mohammed, and the numerous cliques of Arabs who
whined or rebelled against his imperial sway swelled
the chorus of malignant defamation; his followers, on
the contrary, have been guilty of the most fanatical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p. 26]</span>
panegyrics. Buffeted and disfigured between these
two intensely antagonistic forces of opinion, the massive
figure of Mohammed must forever remain largely ambiguous
and enigmatical. His Boswells were too Boswellian,
and his Froudes were too Froudish. And yet,
by steering a zigzag course between the Scylla of
rhapsodical praise and the Charybdis of envious detraction,
it may be possible to arrive at a relatively
detached and peaceful haven where the immeasurable
Arab looms a little less vaguely through the remoteness
of thirteen centuries.</p>

<p>There seems to be little doubt that he was descended
from those lofty Koreish whose opposition, which at
first nearly succeeded in holding his name in perpetual
oblivion, eventually caused him to emerge into the light
of deathless fame. For a century and a half, his forefathers
had been rulers among the Koreish. In the
middle of the fifth century, Kosai, his ancestor at the
fifth remove, had won the distinction of being the first
man to advance the Koreish to a position of supremacy
over Mecca. At his death his three sons fought for the
honor of succeeding him; but Abd Menaf won out,
and was followed in turn by Hashim&mdash;rich, amorous,
charitable, glorious Hashim!&mdash;and his son Abd Al-Muttalib,
the estimable grandfather of the Prophet.</p>

<p>When Abd Al-Muttalib came into power early in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span>
the sixth century, he fell at first upon evil days. Certain
of the Koreish were unfriendly, the caravan business
had been in a bad way for some time, and the
holy water of Zemzem, no longer used as of yore,
had choked up and was almost forgotten. Abd Al-Muttalib,
who well knew the traditions of its ancient
glory, and who found it difficult to get enough water
from lesser Meccan wells for visiting pilgrims, instituted
a laborious search for the venerable stonework
which was known to have surrounded it. Finally his
virtuous efforts were rewarded, and, aided by his son
Al-Harith, he began to scoop out the debris with which
it was clogged. As he neared the bottom, he came upon
the two golden gazelles, and the swords and suits of
armor, that had been buried there by a Jurhumite king
three centuries before as a suitable hiding place against
the despoliations of his enemies. The Koreish, hearing
of Abd Al-Muttalib’s lucky find, immediately demanded
a share of the booty. It was finally agreed
that the dispute should be settled by the casting of lots:
one for Abd Al-Muttalib, one for the Koreish, and&mdash;inasmuch
as all parties concerned in the row were religiously
minded&mdash;one for the Kaba. Abd Al-Muttalib
got the swords and armor, the Kaba got the gazelles,
and the Koreish got nothing. That very day, indeed,
dated their gradual defection from the faith of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[p. 28]</span>
their fathers; but Abd Al-Muttalib, in an excess
of grateful devotion, beat the gazelles into plates of
gold with which he decorated the interior door of the
Kaba, and, in a similar excess of caution, added a
golden lock and key to the door. His faith was properly
rewarded, for from that day the waters of Zemzem
again flowed without interruption; and so Abd Al-Muttalib
grew in social, financial and religious strength,
and became the father of many pious and powerful
sons. And yet&mdash;such a wayward and capricious dame
is Clio!&mdash;there are those who aver that Mohammed’s
grandfather was not the leading Meccan of his time,
and that most of the stories connected with his name
are fabulous inventions of the Prophet’s hero-worshiping
satellites.</p>

<p>Fortunately, all parties seem agreed that Abdallah,
the youngest and most favored son of Abd Al-Muttalib,
was the unambiguous sire of Mohammed. The ways
of Allah are not less perplexing than the ways of God,
and it appears probable that, had it not been for the
direct intervention of the whimsical Arabian Deity,
Abdallah would have perished before he had begotten
his extraordinary son. During the early years of Abd
Al-Muttalib, when he had but one son to aid him in
his struggles against his political opponents, he had
vowed that, should he ever be favored with ten sons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[p. 29]</span>
he would sacrifice one of them to the Deity. This vow&mdash;rash
enough for any young man, and rashest of all,
perhaps, for an Arab&mdash;was in the course of time providentially
fulfilled; and when lots were cast by the
obedient Abd Al-Muttalib, the fatal die fell upon
Abdallah, his pet boy. The hitherto invincible faith
of Abd Al-Muttalib was tremendously shaken; his
weeping daughters&mdash;for Allah had been more than generous&mdash;also
besought him to cast lots between Abdallah
and ten camels: the conventional substitute for human
bloodshed. For nine successive times the arrow pointed
toward Abdallah&mdash;could it be that Allah was inexorable?
At each throw ten additional camels had been
added to the previous number until, on the tenth throw,
they amounted to an even hundred. Then at last Allah,
who was presumably far more interested in the birth
of Mohammed than in a wilderness of camels, relented
and released his faithful servant from his oath. Thus
a hundred camels perished beneath the sacrificial knife,
Abd Al-Muttalib’s piety was recompensed, Abdallah
was saved, and the miraculous birth of the Prophet
was assured.</p>

<p>It came about thus. Toward the end of 569, Abd
Al-Muttalib had betrothed Abdallah to a Meccan
maiden named Amina; and at the same time, even
though he was over seventy and Allah had abundantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[p. 30]</span>
granted his youthful plea for potency, he himself had
married a radiantly youthful cousin of Amina’s. Some
months later Mecca was invaded by an army under
Abraha, a Christian warrior from Abyssinia, who
brought an elephant in his train&mdash;a prodigy that so
astounded the simple Arabs that the year of the invasion
was ever after called “the Elephant.” He had
come, he said, merely to destroy the impious Kaba, and
he had no desire to shed any man’s blood; but inasmuch
as the Meccans knew that Christian Abraha’s
fervor had already manifested itself in the plunder of
hundreds of camels, they were rightly sceptical of any
promise whatever on his part. Overtures of peace were
unsuccessful, for on no account would the wealthy
Koreish agree to permit the demolition of their most
remunerative mercantile house, and preparations were
accordingly made to offer some feeble resistance to the
invader. Then Abd Al-Muttalib bethought himself of
a possible means to thwart the impending peril. Leaning
on the door of the Kaba, he prayed aloud thus:
“Defend, O Lord, thine own house, and suffer not the
Cross to triumph over the Kaba!” He then made
haste to join the other refugees, who had betaken themselves
to the neighboring crags to watch whatever might
betide. Sharp-eared Allah, aloof in his own particular
Heaven, heard the prayer and promptly answered it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[p. 31]</span>
by inflicting a pestilential disease upon the raiding
Christian hosts. Overwhelmed by the disaster, they
began a confused retreat: hundreds of them died by
the wayside, and Abraha himself, covered with a mass
of poisonous and putrid ulcers, soon expired in terrible
agony. Thus was the Kaba gloriously saved and the
Cross ignominiously overthrown&mdash;an event so prophetical
of coming centuries that its portentous symbolism
demanded an incarnate manifestation. The routed
Christian warriors had barely left the shores of Arabia
when Amina gave birth to a son.</p>


<h3 title="Section 2">II</h3>

<p>His advent, we are told, was decorously surrounded
by all manner of signs and omens. The travail of
Amina was entirely painless; earthquakes loosed the
bowels of mountains and caused great bodies of water,
whose names were unfortunately not specified, to
wither away or overflow; the sacred fire of Zoroaster
which, under the jealous care of the Magi, had spouted
ceaseless flames for nearly a thousand years, was summarily
extinguished; indeed, all the idols in the world&mdash;except,
presumably, the Kaba,&mdash;unceremoniously
tumbled from their exalted places. Immediately after
the babe was born an ethereal light dazzled the surrounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[p. 32]</span>
territory, and, on the very moment when his
eyes were first opened, he lifted them to Heaven and
exclaimed: “God is great! There is no God but
Allah and I am His Prophet!” All these poetic fancies
have been appropriately denounced by Christian
scribes, who have claimed that nature would never have
dignified the birth of a Pagan like Mohammed with
such marvelous prodigies as indubitably attended the
advent and crucifixion of Christ.</p>

<p>In the meantime a tragedy of much moment had occurred.
High-spirited Abdallah&mdash;the lovely youth
whose charms were so compelling that two hundred
languishing virgins are said to have perished from jealous
disappointment on his wedding night&mdash;was already
no more. After remaining with his bride for the customary
period of three days, he had departed on a business
engagement to Gaza; but, on the return trip, he
had sickened and died at Medina. The period of
mourning for him was barely over when his posthumous
son was born. Grief-stricken Abd Al-Muttalib, who
was still bewailing his dead son in the repose of the
Kaba, was so comforted when Amina’s messenger
brought him the glad tidings that he at once headed
a procession of relatives to visit his latest grandchild.
With the tender babe in his arms, he immediately returned
to the Kaba, and, standing beside its holy altar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[p. 33]</span>
he gave thanks to Allah for his mercies and benefits.
One week later Abd Al-Muttalib gave a feast in honor
of the child; and during the course of the festivities the
aged ruler presaged an unspeakably glorious destiny
for his grandson as the dawning leader of his race,
and concluded his remarks by christening him Mohammed,
“the Praised.”</p>

<p>Since the suckling of their own children was not considered
to be a proper vocation for high-born Arab
women, Amina, as a descendant of the lordly Koreish,
rightly refused to nurse her child. For the first few
days of his precarious existence he was nourished by
Thuweiba, a slave of his own uncle, Abu Lahab; yet,
in spite of the brevity of this experience, it is confidently
claimed that Mohammed never forgot it, and
that so long as he lived he regularly sent her clothes
and other gifts. A new nurse then had to be found.
According to some fairly authentic traditions, he spent
his first five years among the Bedouins under the care
of a foster-mother named Halima. At the age of two
he was weaned and taken back to his mother; but she
was so pleased with her lusty-looking baby that she
said: “Take him with thee back again to the desert;
for I fear the unhealthy air of Mecca.” After two
more years the robust but high-strung boy, who, like
most embryo prophets, had an acutely sensitive nervous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[p. 34]</span>
system, showed signs of what was probably an epileptic
attack. His foster-parents were so disturbed that they
at once took him home; and only by the greatest efforts
was Amina able to assuage their fears&mdash;were not most
children normally subject to worms or the croup?&mdash;and
persuade them to take him back to the desert. So
great was their love for the youngster that they did so;
but a year later they were again frightened by recurrent
symptoms, and the five-year-old boy was then
definitely restored to his mother, with whom he remained
for nearly another year. Amina then took him
to Medina, where his father’s maternal relatives dwelt;
for she felt all a mother’s delight in showing off the
pretty and playful tricks of her little son. But another
momentous tragedy now impended. About a
month later she died; and thus Mohammed, at the age
of six, was left an orphan.</p>

<p>Had the lad’s parents, or even one of them, lived
until his maturity! In either case, incalculable results
might have followed: there might have been no Prophet,
no Koran, no Islam&mdash;one is tempted to say that
there might have been no Allah. But they died; and
for the next two years the bereaved boy was cared for
by Abd Al-Muttalib, who loved him with all the partiality
of age. Sometimes, as the old patriarch sat at
ease on a rug shaded from the sun, Mohammed would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[p. 35]</span>
peremptorily usurp his seat. Then the old man’s sons
would try to push the little rascal off, but Abd Al-Muttalib
would say, “Let my little son alone!” and,
baked by the burning sun, would pet Mohammed and
feast his ears on the childish shouts and gurgles of the
victor.</p>

<p>Two years later Abd Al-Muttalib went to join Abdallah
and Amina, and Mohammed, weeping bitterly at
the loss of his kind-hearted protector, was consigned to
the care of his uncle Abu Talib, the second of Abd Al-Muttalib’s
five surviving sons. Az-Zubeir, the eldest,
inherited the official duties of his deceased father; but
he soon passed that honor on to the fourth son, Al-Abbas,
a money-lender, owner of Zemzem, rich, but
unfortunately weak in character. Abu Lahab, the
third son, was destined to be a life-long foe of the
Prophet; but the youngest, Hamza the hunter, was
from the beginning one of his staunchest supporters.
Abu Talib, a dealer in cloths and perfumes, was a poor
man, yet he faithfully cared for his nephew, whom he
almost never let out of his sight. When Mohammed
was twelve, he accompanied Abu Talib on a mercantile
journey to Syria; and various writers have mused at
length on the probable effects of this strange, wild expedition
on his highly susceptible mind. It may be, as
some believe, that the seeds of his heavenly mission were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[p. 36]</span>
sown in his mind during this experience. Whatever
else he was, however, Mohammed was not a youthful
prodigy, and perhaps, as most lads of his age would
have done, he merely had a good time.</p>


<h3 title="Section 3">III</h3>

<p>While Mohammed’s life glided from youth into manhood
without many remarkable changes, certain events
occurred that indelibly fixed the channels of his future.
The death of Abd Al-Muttalib had left the ancient
house of Hashim without a strong leader, and so it happened
that another branch of the Koreish came into
power&mdash;a circumstance that marked the beginning of
the deadly struggle between the Prophet and many of
his kin that attended his whole career. For some years,
it is true, this hostility was latent. During a decade&mdash;from
Mohammed’s tenth to his twentieth year&mdash;all the
Koreish were banded together against the hostile tribe
of the Beni Hawazin in the Sacrilegious War: a struggle
that grew out of a violation of the taboo on fighting
during the sacred months. When Mohammed was
nearly twenty, he accompanied his uncles during one
of the many frays that marked this civil strife; but his
activities seem to have been confined to picking up the
arrows of the enemy and turning them over for the use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[p. 37]</span>
of his uncles. Many years later he remarked: “I remember
being present with my uncles in the Sacrilegious
War; I discharged arrows at the enemy, and
I do not regret it.” But the Prophet of divinity was
always very human, and it seems almost certain that the
enormous prestige of his station induced him occasionally
to indulge in a verbal license pardonable in prophets
if not in lesser men. With a wisdom that has characterized
certain other heroes of divinity, Mohammed
wisely confined his originality and his daring strictly
to his mental activities, and fought only when self-preservation
necessitated it.</p>

<p>The war finally ended in an unsatisfactory truce:
neither side had won, and no dominant personality had
yet emerged from the Koreish. Factionalism soon
grew to be so rife that the descendants of Hashim, and
families of germane origin, formed a confederacy to
punish wrongdoing and secure justice among the different
branches of the Koreish. Mohammed himself
was an interested spectator of the initial ceremonies of
this brotherhood. “I would not exchange for the
choicest camel in all Arabia,” he exclaimed on a later
day, “the remembrance of being present at the oath
which we took in the house of Abdallah when the Beni
Hashim, Zuhra ibn Kilab, and Teim ibn Murra swore
that they would stand by the oppressed.” Thus, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[p. 38]</span>
slow degrees, the breach widened between Mohammed
and the majority of the Koreish.</p>

<p>His early manhood was spent in caring for flocks,
in attending caravan expeditions, and in certain avocations
which, all things considered, indicated that he
was more estimable than the common run of youthful
Arabs. As a shepherd of sheep and goats on the hills
around Mecca, he both conferred benefit upon his penurious
uncle, Abu Talib, and engaged in an occupation
that, as he was careful to point out on a future occasion,
was particularly appropriate for his rank. After
commenting on the similarity between himself and
Moses, David, Jesus, and other seers, he concluded
thus: “Verily there hath been no prophet raised up,
who performed not the work of a shepherd.” He often
accompanied caravans, traveling possibly as far as
Egypt and the Dead Sea. In addition to the money
thus earned, he picked up a mass of miscellaneous information
that he used both to his advantage and disadvantage
in the Koran; for its pages reek with foreign
phrases, now beautiful and now outrageously
grotesque, which even his most intimate friends failed
to comprehend. All writers, including strangely
enough those of the Christian faith, coincide in stating
that his early manhood was marked by an excess of
modesty and a minimum of vice rare, not merely in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[p. 39]</span>
young Arabs, but in the young men of any nation.
It has been maintained, with a cogency no less admirable
than indemonstrable, that his virtue was miraculously
kept immaculate. Mohammed himself, with
forgivable modesty, appears to have believed this. “I
was engaged one night feeding the flocks in company
with a lad of Koreish,” he once narrated, “and I said
to him, ‘If thou wilt look after my flock, I will go into
Mecca and divert myself there, even as youths are wont
by night to divert themselves.’” But the sequel,
though divinely ordained, was rather tame. As he
neared the outskirts of the city, a marriage feast attracted
so much of his time that he fell safely asleep.
Another evening, as he approached the city bent upon
a similar enterprise, strains of celestially somnolent music
made him fall into a second scatheless slumber.
“After this I sought no more after vice,” he affirmed;
but he thought it wise to add the cryptic phrase, “even
until I had attained unto the prophetic office.”</p>

<p>By the time Mohammed was twenty-five, Abu Talib,
whose waxing family was constantly restricting his already
limited means, decided that it was high time for
his dependent nephew to shift for himself. “I am, as
thou knowest, a man of small substance,” he remarked
one day to Mohammed, “and truly the times deal hardly
with me. Now here is a caravan of thine own tribe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[p. 40]</span>
about to start for Syria, and Khadija, daughter of
Khuweilid, needeth men of our tribe to send forth with
her merchandise. If thou wert to offer thyself, she
would readily accept thy services.” The double-edged
nature of the conclusion presumably escaped both men;
but the complaisant Mohammed acceded and was soon
off on the journey, accompanied by Meisara, the servant
of Khadija. Mohammed had thus far had little
business experience, but he always showed a many-sided
talent for barter and compromise, and he therefore
returned with a credit that did him high honor.
As the caravan approached Mecca, Meisara induced
him to carry the good news to Khadija in person.
That lady, a wealthy widow of about forty and
the mother of three children, was highly elated at Mohammed’s
story; and, as she listened to the proof of
his business ability and fondly scanned his large, nobly
formed head, his curling, coal-black hair, his
dark, piercing eyes, and his comely form, it naturally
occurred to her that this vigorous and handsome
young fellow would make an excellent successor to her
deceased husband. She had turned down the proposals
of many vehement Koreishite suitors; but here was
one for whom, if necessary, she herself was prepared
to do the wooing&mdash;for Arab ladies rarely entertained
any foolish feminine scruples about such matters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[p. 41]</span></p>

<p>It was necessary; but she moved with discretion.
She sent an envoy, probably Meisara, to find out why
Mohammed was so timid about matrimony; for most
Arabs married at about eighteen and lived in poverty
ever after. “What is it, O Mohammed, that hindereth
thee from marriage?” queried the messenger. “I have
nothing in my hands wherewithal I might marry,” he
replied; for he still retained painful memories of a proposal
refused by one of his cousins, on the sensible
grounds that he had not the proper means to support
her. “But if haply that difficulty were removed,” he
was asked, “and thou wert invited to espouse a beautiful
and wealthy lady of noble birth, who would place
thee in affluence, wouldst thou not desire to have her?”
“But who might it be?” he quickly inquired. “It is
Khadija.” “But how can I attain unto her?” “Let
that be my care,” he was told, and he immediately responded,
“I am ready.”</p>

<p>Khadija was overjoyed at this news; but, according
to custom, she still had to win the consent of her father
despite her age and her manifold attainments. So she
prepared a feast and made him drunk; she then commanded
that a cow should be killed, and, drenching her
intoxicated parent in perfumes, she clothed him in the
requisite matrimonial robes. Under such circumstances
the old man unconsciously performed the ceremony,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[p. 42]</span>
but when he recovered he looked with amazement
on all the numerous signs of a wedding, and stupidly
inquired what it all meant. Upon learning the
facts, and upon being misinformed to the effect that
“the nuptial dress was put upon thee by Mohammed,
thy son-in-law,” he staggered up in high wrath and
swore that his daughter, whose hand had been sought
by the most eminent Koreishites, should never be the
bride of such a shiftless ne’er-do-well as Mohammed.
Even after the story had been corrected he still refused
to relent, and a tribal war might have followed had he
not shortly calmed down and decided to make the best
of a bad job. During the next fifteen years Mohammed
led a tranquil life. His future was provided for;
he had plenty of leisure to occupy himself as he chose,
for Khadija insisted upon running her own business
affairs; and, notwithstanding her seasoned maturity,
there seems to be little reasonable doubt that he became
the father of four daughters and an indeterminate
number of sons.</p>

<p>Not wishing to remain entirely idle, however, he acquired
a partner and established a general barter and
trade business in Mecca&mdash;a fact that doubtless explains
the frequent depiction of Allah as a divine bookkeeper
in the Koran: “God is good at accounts,” and so on.
Years later, in the heyday of his fame at Medina, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[p. 43]</span>
still bought goods wholesale and retailed them at an
excellent profit, and he also employed his stentorian
voice as an auctioneer. All his children turned out to
be sickly. His son, or sons, died in infancy, and his
oldest daughter lived less than forty years; hence historians
who possess a flair for matters pertaining to
medicine have made the deduction that perhaps, after
all, his youthful zest was not guarded by Heaven, but
was expended in most deplorable channels. During
these years Mohammed and his wife continued to be
conventional idolators who performed nightly rites in
honor of various gods and goddesses&mdash;among whom
Allah and his female consoler Al-Lat ranked fairly
high&mdash;and who gave Pagan names to their children.
And so, by the year 610, Mohammed at forty was nothing
more than a respectable but unknown tradesman
who had experienced no extraordinary crisis, whose few
extant sayings were flat and insipid, and whose life
seemed destined to remain as insignificant and unsung
as that of any other Arab.</p>

<h3 title="Section 1">I</h3>

<p class="firstpara">The steps by which Mohammed emerged from obscurity
into the full glow of his messianic mission can never
be traced with any certainty. Explanations and interpretations
in plenty&mdash;economic, rationalistic, psychological,
mediumistic, and so on&mdash;have too often been
advanced with placid and perfect assurance; but unfortunately
they have not overcome the main difficulty:
Mohammed himself. The enigma of his character&mdash;a
fusion of the furthest limits of charlatanism, demagoguery,
bombastic egotism, and general intellectual
incompetency, with the opposite extremes of willing
martyrdom, unaffected simplicity and sincerity, and
lightning flashes of divine poetry&mdash;still remains essentially
unchallenged and intact. He used tricks common
to fakirs&mdash;was he therefore a complete and unabashed
fakir? He began as a humble religious leader, and
he ended as an adroit politician and powerful general&mdash;was
he therefore dishonest from the start? He hid
himself during battles&mdash;was he therefore always a coward?
He often broke faith with friend and foe alike&mdash;was
he therefore utterly unscrupulous? And yet....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[p. 45]</span>
He quite certainly believed in the divinity of his
mission&mdash;was he therefore wholly sincere? He wrote
some passages almost incomparable in their emotional
beauty&mdash;was he therefore inspired? He kept Allah in
the foreground while he himself remained in the background&mdash;why,
then, did the influence of Allah wane as
the prestige of Mohammed waxed? In short, was he
a vicious paranoiac who developed into a maniacal monster,
or an unrivaled genius who was all that his worshipers
claimed&mdash;or both?</p>

<p>Such interrogations face the tracker of Mohammed’s
career at every turn of the journey, and, in avoiding
the pitfalls on one side, he is very likely to stumble into
the abysses on the other. For the facts of his life are
at once too abundant and too few; and he who ponders
them is ever apt to discover that, just at the moment
when he confidently believes he is on the right path, he
knows both too much and too little. The rainbow’s end
is forever at hand and yet forever distant; and similarly
the intangible, chameleon-like personality of Mohammed
constantly eludes and mocks one at the precise
time when one is most confident of touching and cornering
the flitting phantom. Under the circumstances, a
rapid recapitulation of such concrete events as have
been handed down with a minimum of bias is perhaps
least likely to lead one too far astray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[p. 46]</span></p>


<h3 title="Section 2">II</h3>

<p>When Mohammed was about thirty-five, the holy
Kaba, beaten and broken by a violent flood, was in sad
need of repair. A Grecian ship, that had been providentially
wrecked on the coast of the Red Sea near by,
furnished the materials necessary for its reconstruction.
So great was the reverence emanating from the sacred
walls, however, that the Koreish feared the imposition
of heavenly wrath on those who made bold to tear the
building down; but one fellow, braver than the rest,
raised an apologetic prayer to Allah and simultaneously
struck a heavy blow with a pickaxe. All those present,
including the assaulter, then fled and lingered timorously
until morning, when the incredible fact was noted
that Allah had not spoken one way or the other, and
so the structure was rapidly demolished. All went well
with the building operations until the time came to replace
the Black Stone in the eastern corner&mdash;an honor
so great that each branch of the Koreish contended for
it, until bloodshed was imminent. Finally the eldest
patriarch in the city arose and advanced this ingenious
solution: “O Koreish, hearken unto me! My advice
is that the man who chanceth first to enter the court of
the Kaba by yonder gate, he shall be chosen either to
decide the difference amongst you, or himself to place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[p. 47]</span>
the stone.” Universal applause followed and everyone
waited to learn who should be the lucky man. Just
at this moment the unostentatious yet dignified form
of Mohammed was seen to approach, and all the people
shouted in unison: “Here comes the faithful arbiter;
we are content to abide by his decision.” Mohammed,
ever cool and composed in public, calmly accepted the
appointment and immediately devised a supremely
clever diplomatic scheme that would certainly be satisfactory
to all. He removed his cloak and laid it on
the ground; then, putting the awful stone on it, he
said: “Now let one from each of your four divisions
come forward, and raise a corner of this mantle.” This
was done and, when the rock was level with the cavity,
he himself thrust it in position. Thus the unpretentious
tradesman rose in the twinkling of an eye to high
eminence in the esteem of his townsmen. Since Mohammed’s
mind always took to omens and auguries as
a duck takes to water, it is possible that this occurrence
marked the vague inception of his mission.</p>

<p>At all events, about five years later his neighbors
became much mystified by his behavior. He would retire,
for days at a stretch, to a cave in the foothills of
Mount Hira, a conical hill several miles north of Mecca,
whither Khadija too sometimes went with him. Meanwhile
his business languished, and various conjectures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[p. 48]</span>
were advanced to account for his odd conduct&mdash;was
the fellow crazy, or afflicted with some loathsome disease,
or was he perchance engaged in some such nefarious
occupation as counterfeiting? As the months
passed, he still continued to act in the same incomprehensible
manner, and it was noticed that, little by little,
certain members of his immediate family attended him
to his refuge, or gathered with him in some one of their
own houses. This sort of thing went on for several
years, until it was noised abroad that the quondam merchant
and camel-driver was confidently claiming the
honor of having made the epochal discovery which he
phrased thus: “<i lang="ar">La ilaha illa Allah, Mohammed rasul
Allah</i>”&mdash;which, freely interpreted, means: “There is
no god but Allah, and Mohammed is His Prophet.”</p>

<p>This brief, twofold credo demands considerable attention.
The first postulate was not entirely new, for
Allah had hitherto been a well-behaved deity Who was
highly regarded by many Arabs; yet, after all, He had
been but one of many idols. By what process of
thought had Mohammed come to exalt Allah not
merely above all Arabian gods, but above the gods of
all time? and furthermore, why was he so certain of his
own intimate association with Allah?</p>

<p>Various explanations were offered by his simple-minded
followers. According to one account, as Mohammed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[p. 49]</span>
was wandering near the cave, “an angel from
the sky cried to him, ‘O Mohammed, I am Gabriel!’
He was terrified, for as often as he raised his head,
there was the apparition of the angel. He hurried
home to tell his wife. ‘O Khadija,’ he said, ‘I have
never abhorred anything as I do these idols and soothsayers;
and now verily I fear lest I should become a
soothsayer myself.’ ‘Never,’ replied his faithful wife,
‘the Lord will never suffer it thus to be.’” So she made
haste to get the opinion of her own relative, the aged
visionary Waraka, who, after listening attentively to
her tale, cried aloud: “By the Lord he speaketh truth!
Doubtless it is the beginning of prophecy, and there
shall come upon him the <em>Great Namus</em>, like as it came
upon Moses.” According to another story that is even
more edifying, Khadija discreetly tested the genuineness
of the angelic guest by making Mohammed sit
first on her right knee, and then on her left; and the
spirit did not object to either procedure. But when
she took Mohammed in her lap and started to remove
some of her garments, the virtuous apparition departed
in great haste, and the crafty Khadija then
exultantly cried: “Rejoice ... for by the Lord! it
is an angel, and no devil.”</p>

<p>These enlightening tales, however, deserve to be supplemented
by certain other considerations. Outside of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[p. 50]</span>
Arabia, Paganism was in general disrepute. The dissolute
and declining Romans were cracking lewd jokes
in the very faces of their gods; the myriad followers
of Confucius, Buddha and Zoroaster were either too
remote or too helpless to matter one way or another;
Talmudic Judaism and Oriental Christianity despised
idolatry and worshiped the same Jehovah, even though
they disputed with each other, and indeed among themselves,
concerning the various attributes, amorous pursuits,
and lineal descendants of the Godhead. Now,
to one who chose to regard himself as a prophet, monotheism
had distinct advantages over polytheism. For
one thing, it was rather confusing to attempt to obey
the behests of conflicting deities; and for another, the
different prophets of Jehovah in Judaism and Christendom
had, so far as Mohammed knew, been uniformly
successful&mdash;for he was familiar with the glorious history
of Abraham, Moses and David, and he always held
to the perverse belief that Jesus was not crucified.
However deep in the dumps prophets may have been
on occasion, they have invariably believed one thing:
victory for their particular cause will inevitably come.
Neither an unbroken series of worldly failures nor the
chastisements of his God have ever shaken the faith
of a first-class prophet in himself&mdash;or, as he would
doubtless prefer to say, in his Divinity. Arabia&mdash;broken,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[p. 51]</span>
unorganized, inglorious, idolistic Arabia&mdash;obviously
lacked one Supreme Being whose prerogative
was greater than all other Supreme Beings; and that
Being, in turn, needed a messenger to exploit His
supremacy. The messengers who had served Jehovah
had certainly prospered well; but Jehovah Himself
appeared to be on the decline&mdash;His Unity was steadily
disintegrating into a paradoxical Trinity. Why, therefore,
not give Allah, perhaps the leading icon in Arabia,
an opportunity? Such considerations quite probably
never entered the head of Mohammed with any definiteness;
yet his behavior for the rest of his days seems to
indicate that these, or similar conceptions, were subconsciously
egging him on.</p>

<p>Of certain facts, moreover, he was definitely aware.
He may have had little or no formal education, but his
memory was retentive and capacious, and his caravan
journeys, together with the scores of conversations he
had held at the yearly fairs, as well as at Mecca, with
many cultivated strangers, had packed his mind with a
mass of highly valuable if heterogeneous matter. In
these ways he had learnt both the strength and the weakness
of the Jews and Christians: their fanatical enthusiasms
and despairs; their spasmodic attempts to
proselytize as well as the widespread defections from
their faiths; the loftiness of their moral and political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[p. 52]</span>
codes&mdash;a loftiness that remained fruitless from their
lack of cohesion and effectual leadership. Since his
conception of religion was largely personal&mdash;for he
looked upon Moses, Jesus and the rest merely as capable
men who had founded and promulgated religions&mdash;and
since Arabia had no preëminent ruler, why should
<em>he</em> not seize the reins of power and carry on the great
tradition of prophethood? What a magnificent opportunity
beckoned, and how fortunate that he had
been the first to recognize the call! By keeping only
what was best in the Arabic faith&mdash;the Kaba and the
Black Stone&mdash;and by a judicious selection of the most
feasible ideas that lay imbedded in Jewish and Christian
precepts, he might establish a code that would
supersede all others, and might then dictate to all Arabs
alike. What prophets had done, he would also do&mdash;and
do better. Furthermore, he knew something else:
he had a wealthy wife and four intimates who were
already prepared to fight for him to the death.</p>

<p>Khadija rated first. From the beginning she had
stood faithfully by his side, and whenever he was low-spirited
and his heavenly visitations were temporarily
suspended, she would tenderly comfort him&mdash;for the
sad memories of her first marriage had made her determined
that her second husband should succeed in whatever
business he undertook. Her cousin, the learned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[p. 53]</span>
mystic Waraka, readily abandoned his firm conviction
that Christ was the only true prophet in favor of his
cousin-in-law’s exclusive claim to the same honor; and
it is probable that he, more than any other person, enlightened
Mohammed’s many-sided ignorance of religious
history. Mohammed had early adopted his
youthful cousin Ali, son of Abu Talib, and the attachment
between them had come to be mutually strong.
He had also assumed control of Zeid, a Christian slave,
who became so devoted to his master that, when he was
offered his freedom, he replied: “I will not leave thee;
thou art in the place to me of father and of mother.”
This pleased Mohammed so much that he immediately
escorted Zeid to the Black Stone and said: “Bear
testimony, all ye that are present. Zeid is my son; I
will be his heir, and he shall be mine.” In his thirty-ninth
year Mohammed had become acquainted with
Abu Bekr&mdash;commonly called either “the Sighing” or
“the True”&mdash;a rich cloth merchant who was middle-aged
and short, and who had deep-set eyes. Shrewd
and penetrating in business concerns, mentally stable,
and untroubled by too many disturbing ideas and emotions,
he was just the sort of person Mohammed most
needed: a devoted adherent who would serve as business
agent for the new faith.</p>

<p>But in the beginning these were all. Some of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[p. 54]</span>
immediate relatives did not take him very seriously:
Abu Lahab grimaced in his face, and even the charitable
Abu Talib smiled rather derisively at his curious actions.
We are told that Abu Talib, chancing to apprehend
his son Ali and Mohammed contorting themselves
according to the precepts of Islam, thereupon
remarked that he would not care to twist himself so that
his middle portion would be higher than his head&mdash;a
flippancy that Ali cherished and chuckled over years
after his father’s death. Meanwhile the great bulk of
the Koreish were too contemptuously indifferent to pay
any heed to Mohammed’s strange yarnings, though occasionally,
as he passed cliques of them on the streets,
they would lazily point him out as a harmless and but
mildly amusing dunce.</p>


<h3 title="Section 3">III</h3>

<p>Without applauding or deprecating this Koreishite
behavior, we may at any rate impartially consider its
origin. The hitherto mentally and emotionally normal
trader, husband and father had found himself suddenly
swept off his feet and carried irresistibly away on a
mighty tide: the perverse, inexplicable desire to write
poetry&mdash;a fantasy that could not fail to make him the
laughing-stock of all right-minded Meccans. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[p. 55]</span>
curious, how odd, that he, a well-to-do merchant who
had looked forward to nothing more exciting than a
peaceful and prosperous future, should be summarily
wrenched from his moorings and cast adrift upon such
a strange, tempest-tossed sea! Surely, surely, there
was some marvelous meaning in the business&mdash;if he
could but find it. And so, stabbed by agonizing doubts
or transported with rapturous ecstasies, he plunged
blindly on, seeking relief from his vague imaginings in
intermittent bursts of formless, rhapsodical verse. His
perturbed spirit now soared to the heights of Heaven
and now plunged into the chasms of Hell; moments of
ethereal bliss would be followed by periods of the profoundest
melancholy. In short, he was passing through
the throes of an experience closely akin to religious conversion&mdash;an
experience that can end in but one of three
ways: in a relapse into sin, in suicide, or in a more or less
enduring catharsis of the spirit. Though Mohammed
was too strong a man to return to the fleshpots of
Arabia&mdash;if, indeed, he had ever tasted them&mdash;it is
almost certain, as the earliest fragments of the Koran
hint, that he meditated self-destruction for a time; but
Allah, the All-Compelling, the Mighty One, had other
plans.</p>

<p>It is related that the angel Gabriel, who thus far had
labored only in the field of Christian employment, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[p. 56]</span>
chosen by Allah as bearer of the divine revelation to
Mohammed. One day, while the trader-poet was
wrestling with his doubts among the foothills of Mount
Hira, he saw a wondrous apparition floating downward
on celestial wing. Coming within a distance of
two bowshots&mdash;for the Arabs are very accurate about
such things&mdash;the divine envoy exposed a tablet covered
with heavenly hieroglyphs before Mohammed’s astonished
eyes and exclaimed, “Read!” “I cannot read,”
replied Mohammed; but again the unearthly voice uttered
the word, “Read!” And then, impelled by an irresistible
power, Mohammed fixed his entranced eyes
upon the document and began to chant thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Recite in the name of the Lord who created&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Created Man from nought but congealed blood;&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Recite! For thy Lord is beneficent....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and so on, until the end. “Thou art God’s Prophet,
and I am Gabriel,” announced the awe-inspiring guest
before he departed to receive the blessing of Allah for
having so successfully executed the heavenly command.
Gabriel, in truth, was a very valuable ambassador, for,
through the to and fro journeyings of this indefatigable
messenger, Allah was able to remain at ease in Heaven,
thus keeping up that appearance of intangible, majestic
remoteness so necessary for dignified gods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[p. 57]</span></p>

<p>And thus Mohammed came into his own. From that
moment he looked upon himself as Allah’s vicegerent,
through whom Allah’s incontestable decrees were to be
given to man&mdash;although Gabriel, or the Holy Ghost
(for Mohammed’s slipshod knowledge of Christian
theogony led him into the regrettable error of perpetually
confusing those two eminent divinities), continued
in his capacity as interpreter of the intermittently
revealed series of tablets. And so careful was
Allah to eliminate the possibility of merely human invention
that He prefaced every Sura, or individual
revelation, with the express or implied injunction “<span class="allsmcap">SAY</span>”
or “<span class="allsmcap">SPEAK</span>”&mdash;the irrefutable proof of divine authorship.
Mohammed’s every doubt had now vanished, his soul
was completely at ease; and from his lips there burst
the wildly exultant chant: “<i lang="ar">La ilaha illa Allah, Mohammed
rasul Allah!</i>”</p>

<p>Such, we may believe if we so desire, was the origin
of the Koran, of Mohammed the Prophet, and of Islam
itself&mdash;those three interacting and inseparable forces (a
sort of Pagan Trinity, in fact) which, emerging when
Rome was dying and Christianity was barely out of
its cradle, convulsed the civilized and uncivilized world
for centuries to come. Inasmuch, however, as Mohammed
himself, not to mention his commentators, has added
certain clarifying details that were touched with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[p. 58]</span>
earthiness foreign to the pretty picture, it may not
be wholly presumptuous or irreverent to glance briefly
at the other side of the canvas.</p>

<p>The conception of a flexible revelation&mdash;of one that
could be indefinitely extended, amended, expurgated,
or even abrogated in part&mdash;was excellent in many ways.
Christianity and Mormonism, to cite only two counter
cases, have both suffered somewhat, perhaps, from the
inexorable nature of their scriptures. Woe unto him
who alters a jot or tittle of their contents! At the same
time, the precise meaning of the Christian creed, in
particular, is very indefinite; it permits a latitude of
interpretation, even in fundamental matters, that has
brought about those lamentable schisms into major,
minor and microscopic sects with which everyone is
familiar. But, however much civil strife Islam may
have endured from political factionalism or antagonism
over inconsequential tenets in the Koran, it has remained
indissolubly firm in its adherence to its supereminent
divinities: Allah and Mohammed. And the credit for
this, it is to be suspected, is due principally to the one
whom all orthodox Moslems believe&mdash;or profess they
believe&mdash;to be the lesser.</p>

<p>Poetry and oratory&mdash;the only forms of literature
known to the Arabs&mdash;were both oracular and rudely
rhythmical; and Mohammed, who from his childhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[p. 59]</span>
had been familiar with the yearly contests of poets and
orators at the fairs, naturally adopted a cognate medium
of expression. His thoughts, whether conceived in a
white heat of frenzy or with deliberate coolness and sly
calculation for the main chance, were probably not written
down in any definite way during his life. It is not
certain, in fact, that he could either read or write. He
delighted in the appellation “the illiterate Prophet,”
possibly on account of his humility, and possibly because
he knew that inspired ignorance had been the
indisputable prerogative of all successful prophets in
the past. Indeed, the very fact that he was unlearned
was rightly supposed to increase the miraculous nature
of his revelations. As he tossed the divine emanations
from his lips, they were sometimes recorded by hired
or willing scribes upon palm leaves, leather, stones, the
shoulder-blades or ribs of camels and goats, or were
even tattooed upon the breasts of men. But often they
were not immediately written down at all; the Prophet
would go around spouting them forth to his followers
who, trained from infancy to memorize verses and songs
of every sort with infallible precision, would piously
commit them to memory. As a result of this divinely
haphazard procedure, the time of composition of the
different Suras has never been definitely fixed. Two
facts, however, are well established: the revelations, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[p. 60]</span>
first very short, steadily increased in length; and, doubtless
for that reason, the interminable later Suras do not
even contain ashes&mdash;for ashes prove that flame was once
present&mdash;whereas the earlier songs are occasionally
touched with fire.</p>

<p>Occasionally ... but only so. The indefeasible
privilege of all Holy Writ to be dull&mdash;a privilege only
too generously exercised&mdash;is abused in the Koran with
an enthusiasm matched only by the third part of the
Pentateuch. The spasmodic structure of the Koran&mdash;its
absence of cohesion between chapters and even between
sentences, its dithyrambic convulsions, its hodge-podge
of inchoate and irrelevant ideas, its pervasive
lack of charm&mdash;may be due, it has been hazarded, to
Mohammed’s neurotic idiosyncrasy; yet epileptic men
of genius in many branches of mental activity have been
by no means uncommon, and it seems simpler to assume
that he was not born to be a poet. In any case, it is certain
that his predilection for non-didactic poetry showed
itself only at rare intervals: perhaps because, as the
Koran puts it, “We have not taught him poetry, nor is
it meet for him,” perhaps because he had had no
genuine love-affair in his youth, and perhaps because he
believed that his commission was too serious to allow
any protracted indulgence in such a frivolous thing as
verse. Like the Hebrew prophets, he was at his best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[p. 61]</span>
when raining heavenly maledictions on his enemies;
like them, too, he was at his worst when he used repetition
as a substitute for ideas. But they at least had
good stories, taken from a long and rich racial history,
to redecorate as they saw fit, whereas Arabia had almost
no history worth the telling; and so Mohammed was
compelled to fall back on Hebrew literature to help him
out. He did fall back&mdash;again and again, and yet
again. Even if he could not read, it was easy to get
the necessary material from friendly Jews in Mecca;
but an unfortunate, though apparently disregarded,
difficulty attended this procedure: different Jews
would tell the same story in different ways. So it came
about that, when the Prophet was hard pressed for
material, he would use one version; again, when his
clock of inspiration had run down or been left unwound,
he would use another garbled rendition of the
same narrative. While the story of Joseph was his
favorite, his collection of trophies pillaged from Biblical
folklore included the activities of Noah, Abraham,
Moses, David and less important notables; at the same
time, he was quite innocent of the common Christian
complaint that he had plagiarized the Bible, inasmuch
as he had never read it. Carlyle was certainly not a
tepid admirer of Mohammed, but, when he read the
Koran, even his Berserker rage for great men suffered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[p. 62]</span>
a serious shock&mdash;a shock that might justly be criticized
for the very thing it criticizes. “I must say,” he confessed,
“it is as toilsome reading as I ever undertook.
A wearisome, confused jumble, crude, incondite; endless
iterations, long-windedness, entanglement; most
crude, incondite;&mdash;insupportable stupidity, in short!
Nothing but a sense of duty would carry any European
through the Koran.” And indeed, so far as that volume
is concerned, the European sense of duty has been
very small.</p>

<p>But with Mohammed’s acolytes the case has been
wholly different. For from the beginning they believed
in the Koran with an appallingly artless simplicity,
at once noble and absurd. Through its instrumentality,
Allah the Wise, the Only Wise, revealed his
immutable decrees: to the good, the rewards of a
Paradise that utterly beggared the Christian Heaven,
and to the bad the punishments of a Hell that contained
an infinity of such refined tortures of heat, and even of
cold, as neither the most imaginatively gifted Jew nor
Christian had yet conceived&mdash;for Dante was undreamed
of. Mohammed of course properly approved of Allah’s
decisions and judgments, as an employee should
rightly behave toward his employer; and he was especially
fond of his superior’s delight in describing Hell&mdash;“I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[p. 63]</span>
swear,” he gravely announced one day, “that it is
one of the most serious things.”</p>

<p>The earlier part of the Koran, or “Recitation,” is
mostly concerned with these elemental and primitive
things; only at a later day did Allah&mdash;or Mohammed?&mdash;deal
separately with the many matters touching the
growth of a definite code of religious, social and governmental
precepts. When scoffers poked ridicule at the
rather sloppy grammar and metre of the Koran, Mohammed
did two things: in the first place, after brandishing
the doom of an eternity of roaring flames over
their heads, he challenged them to produce better verses
than his&mdash;or Allah’s?&mdash;own; and, in the second place,
he incautiously prepared a loophole of escape by revealing,
in Sura 69, the fact that the Koran was “not
the word of a poet,” but “a revelation from the Lord
of the Worlds.” This lofty gesture temporarily
squelched his defamers, who promptly dug off with
their tails between their legs; but its effect did not last
long when they reflected how damaging an admission
he had made. It may of course be readily granted
that precepts concerned with daily washing, food, taxes,
and so on, were not especially well adapted to rhythmical
prose; but, after all, that was Allah’s and Mohammed’s
lookout. Perhaps, indeed, the confession of non-poetical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[p. 64]</span>
power was scarcely necessary; for the inexplicable
man who, in the pristine freshness of poetic
glow, could indite this terse stanza, instinct with brooding
doom:</p>

<h3 title="Section 1">I</h3>

<p class="firstpara">Islam, the doctrine of “resignation to God,” was now
started on its way; but mystery hovers over every stage
of the journey. The various explanations that have
been devised to account for its marvelously rapid development
have commonly just enough plausibility to
make them romantically misleading; for the charm of
a half-truth lies in its Lethean amalgamation of realism
and fancy: it displays neither the dulness of unadorned
fact nor the superficiality of exotic fabrication. In
recent times Mohammed and his era have inevitably
been subjected to treatment according to principles
derived from the “scientific method.” Now, while it is
unquestionably true that a large amount of invaluable
information has been accumulated thus, it is also true
that the excessive use of this method has given rise to
some definite dangers&mdash;dangers that are all the more
alluring and deceptive because they bear the stamp of
contemporary approval. For one thing, its adherents
often lack the ability to apply the principle to their own
mental processes: they sometimes manifest a bias as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[p. 66]</span>
essentially unscientific as the fervent prayer of the most
benighted Moslem. For another thing, its devotees
frequently dispute among themselves over the validity
of its countless ramifications with an enthusiasm unexcelled
by political fanatics; and, for still another thing,
the method itself is as much a product of conditions
peculiar to the so-called Modern World as Islamism
was a logical excrescence of the deplorable Dark Ages.</p>

<p>Although Mohammed’s parents died so early as to
deprive the Freudians of the opportunity to dissect him
in a manner compatible with the most cherished articles
of their faith, other not wholly dissimilar schools of
thought have not failed to wield their scalpels&mdash;oftentimes
with very considerable effect. For example,
those who look upon him as a largely self-conscious
medium who was extraordinarily skillful and successful
in employing the cabalistic devices used by mediums
as a class, have much to warrant their belief. The evidence
extant in support of this view, in fact, merits
respect if not complete acceptance. For the whole
business of Allah, and Gabriel, and the magical tablets&mdash;whose
precious contents none but Mohammed might
gaze upon, and he only at infrequent intervals&mdash;is, to
say the least, very intriguing. The problem that fronts
all mediums is this: how to produce their messages without
arousing the suspicion that they themselves are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[p. 67]</span>
authors; and innumerable devices are used to attain this
end. It has been suggested that the Prophet himself
may have solved the problem by a subtly clever device&mdash;his
known susceptibility to epileptic fits. Before
giving vent to one of Allah’s inditements, he would
snore, cover himself with a blanket, and remain thus
until, drenched with sweat, he emerged and gave his
message. One traditional account runs thus: “He fell
to the ground like an inebriate, or one overcome by
sleep; and in the coldest day his forehead would be bedewed
with large drops of perspiration. Even his she-camel,
if he chanced to become inspired while mounted
on her, would be affected by a wild excitement, sitting
down and rising up, now planting her legs rigidly, then
throwing them about as if they would be parted from
her.” In the earlier Koran, he is characterized as the
“man in the blanket,” or the “man who is wrapped up.”
For he fully appreciated the necessity of keeping his
followers in a state of protracted mystification, and to
that end he made use of many theatrical tricks. He
would drum up a crowd with his ludicrous snortings and
puffings until the resounding cry, “Inspiration hath
descended on the Prophet!” assured him that he had a
sufficiently large audience to warrant the ebullition of
a new Sura. While in a room that was obviously
empty, he declared that all the seats were occupied by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[p. 68]</span>
angels; he cultivated a suave and benign expression; he
flattered and astounded his adherents by telling them
intimately personal facts about themselves which he
had presumably acquired through private information;
he took the most painstaking care of his person&mdash;painted
his eyes and perfumed his entire body every
day, wore his hair long and probably dyed it when it
became gray, and there is reason to believe that he
always wore a veil. Eventually, he so perfected his
technique that he could throw a cataleptic fit and produce
a message without any previous preparation. In
the midst of a meal he would contort himself, disgorge
a new injunction, and then calmly finish his dinner.</p>

<p>Nor does the case for the prosecution end here. The
manner in which his early disciples were won and organized
suggests that like principles were employed.
In the beginning, Islam was a profoundly secret society,
whose leader frowned upon publicity but encouraged
furtive proselytizing on a great scale&mdash;a policy of
action that turned out to be perfectly suited to the situation.
For this privacy doubtless saved the cause from
early obliteration, while at the same time it offered the
romantic attraction of a Jekyll-and-Hyde existence to
those who accepted Islam&mdash;a circumstance decidedly
favorable to the growth of any surreptitious conclave;
and, in addition, it gave Mohammed time to pick and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[p. 69]</span>
choose his lieutenants with care, as well as to school himself
in the lessons needed for ruling heterogeneous
masses of men. While all this was going on, he himself
remained aloof in august, inaccessible grandeur, for
none could see him who was not already rabid with desire
to prostrate himself at the Prophet’s feet. Thus,
in those clandestine gatherings held in the house of the
convert Al-Arkam&mdash;a house afterward appropriately
immortalized by the title “The House of Islam”&mdash;and
in the febrile activity of Mohammed’s plastic pupils,
headed by the efficient Abu Bekr, is to be found the
germ whence all Islam sprang.</p>

<p>This reasoning sounds very plausible until one reflects:
after all, could it have been as simple as this?
And then an inscrutable image looms in the mind&mdash;the
grotesque, grand, preposterous and prodigious figure
of Mohammed.</p>


<h3 title="Section 2">II</h3>

<p>The secret séances in the House of Al-Arkam continued;
a variety of converts began to pour in; and by
the fourth year of his mission Mohammed dared to
come boldly out into the open and proclaim that he was
the anointed representative of Allah. His proselytes
at first were mostly humble folk: slaves, women unable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[p. 70]</span>
to achieve matrimony, unsuccessful business men, and
others who, discontented with their lot, were either
looking for excitement or willing to take any chance
however desperate. Yet it is a curious fact that every
devotee, except Abu Bekr, showed some aversion before
whole-heartedly accepting the new faith: “I never
invited any one to the faith who displayed not hesitation
and perplexity, excepting only Abu Bekr,” the Prophet
himself admitted. The explanation may lie in the fact
that each proselyte was expected to remain true through
thick and thin; indeed, his life was forfeit if he apostatized&mdash;a
stipulation that, even today, makes the conversion
of a Moslem a very difficult task. Another
possible explanation is this: the converts soon discovered
that Islam was not merely a gospel of salvation through
faith&mdash;an outstanding tenet of all great religions, because
it makes a peculiar appeal to the intellectually
slothful&mdash;but a gospel that demanded a vast amount of
hard work. Mohammed, in fact, had much more in
common with James than with Paul. For if he was a
fanatic in emotional matters, his grosser intellectual
endowments were characterized by an admirable coolness
and a logical precision that often confounded his
friends and his enemies alike&mdash;though it is recorded that
an early convert, who was commissioned to take down
one of the Prophet’s divine ravings, decided to renounce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[p. 71]</span>
Islam when he observed that he was permitted to pen
whatever he chose.</p>

<p>Each newcomer recognized his brothers by the greeting
“Peace unto you,” a password of which Mohammed
was especially fond; and if it was dangerous for a time
to speak the words openly, recognition was made sure
by the adoption of a peculiar style of turban. The
new sect was called Moslems, or “traitors”&mdash;an appellation
that provoked much merriment among Mohammed’s
less serious-minded opponents. He showed
a typical lack of humor in accepting the sobriquet, they
remarked, but he was to be praised for making it an
honorable term; for, while it usually meant one who surrendered
his friends to their foes, it now signified one
who yielded himself to God. The Koran, however, settled
the matter by affirming that the title had been invented
by no less an authority than Abraham himself.</p>

<p>While converts of every type were welcomed, preference
was naturally shown for those who had either physical
or social strength. For a time most of them came
from the descendants or adherents of the house of Hashim,
and so Mohammed, doubtless with the idea of
strengthening the faith by breaking the strong family
and tribal ties, set up brotherhoods between those who
came from different sects. The largeness of his nature
is shown by his readiness to make amends for any wrong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[p. 72]</span>
he had committed. A blind man once interrupted him,
while he was earnestly conversing with a prospective
convert, with the request that the Koran should be read
aloud; and the Prophet, incensed at the ill-timed interruption,
snapped out a harsh refusal. But his heart
soon smote him, and he made atonement for his error
by pointing out in the Koran how unforgivable it was
for him to welcome the rich and powerful while neglecting
the poor and despised. The most valuable of the
slave converts was the negro Bilal, “small in body, but
weighty in faith,” whom Mohammed himself extolled as
“the first fruits of Abyssinia.” Almost all of the first
score of converts remained staunch, though one of them,
Obeidallah, eventually weakened under the strokes of
persecution, became a Christian, and died in that faith;
but Mohammed avenged himself by marrying his
widow.</p>

<p>By far the most important of the Meccan neophytes,
except Khadija and Abu Bekr, were the Prophet’s
uncle Hamza&mdash;a mighty man in hunting, wine and war,
whose valorous conduct won him the title “The Lion of
God”&mdash;and Omar, a veritable Hercules. He had been
a clever trader who once outwitted the assessor of customs
by making his own camel swallow the gold it carried&mdash;and
he then recovered the money by killing the
camel. His most cherished avocations had been wine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[p. 73]</span>
wife-beating, coarse interference in delicate feminine
matters, and bitter hatred of Islam. Informed one day&mdash;so
the most plausible tradition of his conversion runs&mdash;that
his own sister and brother-in-law had yielded to
its seductions, he hastened to their house and greeted
them with the brotherly salutation, “I hear that ye are
renegades!” When they tried to argue with him, he
violently kicked the man and wounded his sister in the
face. These activities so completely restored his good
humor that he asked to see the roll they had been reading.
Having perused a part of one Sura, he exclaimed,
“How excellent is this discourse, and gracious!” adding
that he would like to meet Mohammed. So he
went immediately to Al-Arkam’s house, where the inmates,
including even the redoubtable Hamza, drew back
in alarm; but the Prophet boldly seized his skirt and
sword-belt and asked, “How long, O Omar, wilt thou
not refrain from persecuting, even until the Lord send
some calamity upon thee?” The penitent Omar replied,
“Verily, I testify that thou art the Prophet of
God!” whereupon Mohammed raised the joyous shout:
“Allahu Akbar! Great is the Lord!” So widespread
was the Koreishite fear of Omar that from this moment
the Moslems prayed openly in the city; and the
happy Prophet continued to exult over his prize acquisition
in this fashion: “If Satan were to meet Omar, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[p. 74]</span>
would get out of Omar’s way,” while one of his pet
sayings was, “I, Abu Bekr, and Omar.”</p>

<p>It seems probable that Mohammed at first offered his
disciples no promise of earthly rewards, but seduced
them by painting gorgeously graphic pictures of their
eventual felicity in Paradise, as well as the utter discomfiture
of their foes in Hell. The Koran of this
period abounds with eloquent descriptions of both
places. Paradise is represented as a haven bulging
with sensuous delights of the most naïve and ephemeral
sort. In fact, so much emphasis was put upon food
and drink that a jolly Jew objected on the ground that
such continual feasting must of necessity be followed
by purgation; the Prophet, however, swore that it would
not even be necessary to blow the nose in Paradise, since
all bodily impurities would be carried off by a perspiration
“as odiferous as musk.” Furthermore, he soon
added particular attractions that were far more captivating
than mere gluttony, even though they still
lacked the subtlety of philosophic appeal.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[p. 75]</span></p>
<p class="noindent">He continued to dilate on this theme, rhyming the
heavenly benefactions in pairs; but when he tried to include
the angelic young ladies in the divine catalogue,
their number utterly ruined his rigid metrical scheme,
and he was therefore compelled to expatiate on their
charms in prose: “lovely large-eyed girls resembling
pearls hidden in their shells, a reward for that which the
faithful have wrought.... We have made them
virgins, fascinating, of an equal age.” While thus innocently
occupied, the faithful were to be further entertained
by peering over the celestial battlements and observing
the tortures of the unbelievers, who would be
vainly trying to quench their thirst by drinking boiling
water. “This shall be your entertainment on the Day
of reckoning!” promises the Koran.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Spiritual inducements of this sort, not to mention the
mundane rewards soon to be offered to the pious and
the swift earthly doom promised for backsliders, did not
fail in their effect. And still, despite the accessions to
Islam, the Prophet as late as 615 was subject to public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[p. 76]</span>
insult. The rigorous ban on bloodshed within tribes
saved him from serious personal danger, but he nevertheless
endured some very scurrilous abuse; his enemies
would throw offensive objects at his person, or on his
hearth while he was cooking his simple meals. One day
they tossed in the entrails of a goat, and Mohammed,
putting the refuse on a stick, carried it to the door and
shouted: “Ye children of Abd Menaf! What sort of
good neighborhood is this?” While at his devotions
near the window, he was at times forced to crouch beneath
a projecting stone to escape the missiles of his
foes. But the prestige of his old protector, Abu Talib,
was still very strong and, despite his regrettable adherence
to the ancient faith, he staunchly protected his
incomprehensible nephew from the Koreish. Once, it
is true, Abu Talib’s patience was shaken, and he asked
Mohammed not to cast upon him “a burden heavier than
I can bear.” The Prophet, perturbed by his uncle’s
apparent desertion and by the prospect of his own consequent
loss of protection, burst out crying and started
to leave the room. Then the aged ruler was so moved
that he cried: “Son of my brother, come back! And
now depart in peace! and say whatsoever thou wilt.
For, by the Lord of the Kaba, I will not, in any wise,
give thee up for ever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[p. 77]</span></p>


<h3 title="Section 3">III</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding the ubiquitous respect for Abu
Talib and the equally widespread fear of Omar and
Hamza, the Koreishite hatred of Mohammed became
steadily more menacing. The lowborn fakir-Prophet
might be a person of despicable origin who mouthed a
prodigious amount of insane drivel, but he had certainly
succeeded in kicking up a highly exasperating rumpus.
The devil of it was that the pernicious fellow so skillfully
blended his own revelations with Arabic and Jewish
traditions, whose validity nobody impugned, that the
Koreish could not denounce the one without laying themselves
open to the charge of reviling the other. He appeared
to be wholly impervious, not to say sublimely indifferent,
to the appeal of common sense; for when the
Koreish charged that his Suras were either fabricated by
himself or dictated by abler assistants, he would employ
the most underhanded means to disprove the accusation.
When they suggested that, inasmuch as he
identified himself with the prophets of old, he ought to
trot out a few miracles, he unwisely obliged them by
declaring that the sky would fall upon their impenitent
heads. He realized his mistake, however, when they
promptly demanded that he should fix a date for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[p. 78]</span>
catastrophe; and he then cleverly extricated himself
from his predicament by maintaining that his presence
in the holy city had averted the disaster. But Mohammed
had learnt his lesson, and thereafter he never tampered
with miracles&mdash;a fact that, perhaps more than any
other, indicates his superiority over preceding prophets.</p>

<p>The Koreish, however, had not yet finished with him,
and, as they redoubled their assaults, he met them in
various ways. When one of them affirmed that the
Prophet was a crazy man&mdash;“One taught by others, a
Madman!”&mdash;under the influence of the dreadful Jinn,
he retaliated by accusing his accuser of being a bastard
who could not write, who was head over heels in debt,
and who furthermore deserved a thump on the nose.
When they worsted him in debate, he first lost his temper
and then announced that he had been divinely commanded
not to argue with unbelievers&mdash;for often, as
Mohammed preached to his followers or fulminated
against his antagonists, his cheeks would blaze and his
voice would become shrill, and on one occasion he is
said to have thrown dust on the heads of his opponents.
When another Koreishite accepted the Prophet’s rash
challenge to a poetic duel to test the excellence of the
Koran, Mohammed could do nothing but squirm in discomfiture;
but he amply avenged himself, after the
battle of Bedr, by ordering the summary execution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[p. 79]</span>
the despicable poet. When they pointed out the many
errors of fact that appeared in the Koran, and sneered
at his assertion that the revelation was “in pure Arabic,”
Mohammed at first replied that Allah must know best&mdash;“He
hath revealed it who knoweth that which is hidden
in heaven and in earth: He is forgiving and merciful”&mdash;but,
when he was informed that his answer,
though doubtless inspired, was hardly to the point, he
attempted to dazzle everybody by producing a new
Sura that nobody, not even himself, could comprehend.
For Mohammed invariably trusted in Suras rather than
syllogisms, and wisely quoted no authority save Allah.</p>

<p>If, however, he was safe from direct assault, the more
humble of his auxiliaries&mdash;the slaves, strangers and
lower classes&mdash;who lacked the protection of family ties,
were not so fortunate. They were apprehended, beaten
and jailed, or exposed to the terrific heat of the sun.
Under torments of this sort, some of them naturally
recanted&mdash;a contingency that necessitated swift measures
on the part of Allah. Mohammed, sincerely
moved by their sufferings, announced that, even though
they dissembled to escape torture, Allah was nevertheless
All-Merciful and Forgiving if their hearts were
right; and a Sura forthwith appeared that poured
divine wrath on every backslider, “excepting him who
is forcibly compelled thereto, his heart remaining steadfast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[p. 80]</span>
in the faith.” One day the Prophet met an adherent
who was weeping from the anguish of his
wounds, and asked what the trouble was. “Evil, O
Prophet! They would not let me go until I had abused
thee, and spoken well of their gods.” “But how dost
thou find thine own heart?” “Secure and steadfast
in the faith.” “Then if they repeat their cruelty, repeat
thou also thy words,” advised Mohammed. Yet,
in spite of this heavenly leniency, incessant persecution
continued to diminish his little band, and he therefore
counselled those who were defenseless to take refuge in
Abyssinia. Some of them did so, but still the odious
oppression continued.</p>

<p>The Prophet, in this desperate strait, seems to have
resolved upon a desperate remedy. It is at all events
true that, scarcely three months after the departure of
the little company of refugees, he tried to effect a compromise
with his implacable foes. Approaching a
group of the Koreish in Mecca one day, he reeled off a
Sura which contained the flattering information that
some of their gods, and particularly their goddesses,
were not so bad after all. Having enumerated several
of them, he intoned this passage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“These are exalted Females,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whose intercession verily is to be sought after.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[p. 81]</span></p>
<p class="noindent">At the end of this strange encounter, Mohammed and
his hearers promptly prostrated themselves and worshiped
their individually pampered deities in a spirit
of beautiful brotherhood.</p>

<p>This event probably marks the decadence of the
mystic and the inception of the statesmanlike elements
in Mohammed’s character; but it was destined to bear
bitter fruit. Had his co-workers possessed his aptitude
for mental prestidigitation, all might have gone well;
but, like others of his profession, Mohammed had
stirred up a bigger hornets’ nest than he realized. It
appears that many Moslems, including even those who
had been bribed into accepting Islam, actually believed
that the Prophet had meant what he said about Allah,
and himself, and Islam in general. Whatever it was
that had inspired his retrograde action, Mohammed
turned right-about-face in double-quick time; for another
Sura followed posthaste, which declared that the
Prophet, being very human, was sometimes deceived by
the poisonous whisperings of the devil. It was furthermore
stated that Allah, the Omnipotent, naturally possessed
the power to erase or substitute sections of the
Koran as he desired: “And when We change one
verse in place of another (and God best knoweth that
which He revealeth) they say, ‘Verily thou plainly art
a fabricator.’ Nay! but the most of them understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[p. 82]</span>
not. Say, the Holy Spirit hath brought it down from
thy Lord in truth, to stablish them that believe.” Nevertheless,
the clever device came to naught, for the
Prophet’s overplay of his hand led to two unfortunate
results: the Koreish, more assured than ever that he
was a slippery liar, redoubled their assaults on his devotees;
and Mohammed himself was regarded with suspicious
doubt by some of his most whole-hearted adherents.</p>

<p>Events followed thick and fast. The Prophet, disturbed
and alarmed, advised another emigration to
Abyssinia&mdash;a recommendation that swelled the rising
fury of his enemies. For the Abyssinians, in years
past, had invaded Arabia under Abraha, and what was
more likely than that Mohammed was sending envoys
to negotiate a <i lang="fr">rapprochement</i> with their chiefs&mdash;a contingency
that might foretell a second invasion to assist
the Prophet and overthrow the Koreish? Impelled by
such vague fears, they instituted a device far more effective
than direct attack. Mohammed’s biographers
are not agreed upon the precise time when these events
took place; but it seems probable that, shortly after the
second emigration to Abyssinia (615&ndash;616), the Koreish
issued a decree of excommunication against the family
of Hashim&mdash;which meant practically all of Islam. Its
descendants were banned from intermarriage or other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[p. 83]</span>
business engagements with the Meccans; in brief, the
Pagan bull specified that “dealings of every kind should
cease.” The effect was swift and inevitable&mdash;the relatively
weak Hashimites were compelled to withdraw
their forces from Mecca and retire to a secluded defile
east of the city. And here for an indeterminate period
running from several months to several years, the outlaws&mdash;probably
about one hundred in number&mdash;lived as
best they could by buying scanty provisions at fabulous
prices from passing caravans. Mohammed’s highly
praiseworthy behavior under these desperate conditions
restored, and indeed strengthened, the faith of the suffering
Hashimites; it is even possible that, without this
savage persecution, Islam might soon have died out and
been forgotten in its infancy. For some of the better-class
Moslems had heretofore been showing dangerous
tendencies: they refused longer to kiss the Black Stone;
they showed flagrant disrespect toward their unconverted
relatives; they used obscene language; they even
prayed to Allah while they were drunk; and&mdash;encouraged,
alas! by the Prophet himself&mdash;they coveted the
wives and possessions of the unbelievers. But this
frightful ordeal cleansed their hearts of such wickednesses.
The “blood of the martyrs” was, in all probability,
the seed of Islam’s glorious harvest.</p>

<p>And Mohammed himself was stirred to make even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[p. 84]</span>
greater efforts than ever. With the cries of starving
children ringing in his ears, he would go forth, during
the holy months when amnesty prevailed, to exhort the
tribes that came to the fairs held at Ukaz and other
places. “Ye people!” he would shout, “Say, there is no
God but the Lord. Ye will be benefited thereby. Ye
will gain the rule of Arabia and of foreign lands, and
when ye die ye will reign as kings in Paradise.” While
he was thus engaged, his uncle, Abu Lahab (who had
probably avoided the ban by forswearing his kinship to
the tribe of Hashim), would tag after him, crying out,
“Believe him not, he is a lying renegade!” On another
occasion Abu Lahab yelled: “Blast the fellow! Is
that all that he hath called us for together?” Mohammed
was moved to such fury by this remark that he devoted
one of the many imprecations of the Koran to his
foul-mouthed, profligate uncle and his equally impenitent
spouse.</p>

<p class="noindent">But Abu Lahab, who by fits and starts relied on the
goddess Al-Uzza for protection, did not cease his mud-slinging;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span>
and he was ably assisted by Pagans from
foreign tribes who would taunt Mohammed thus:
“Thine own kindred and people should know thee best;
wherefore is it that they have cast thee off?” Then the
Prophet would turn his face despairingly toward heaven
and say, “O Lord, if Thou willedst, it would not be
thus!” But Allah&mdash;Who, logically, should be as much
of a nomad as his creatures&mdash;seems to have been enjoying
a vacation just then.</p>

<p>In 619 the hostile edict was withdrawn; but the reasons
for its abrogation are obscure. Some believe that
the Koreish lifted it when (it must be repeated that the
dates of these events are vague) Mohammed agreed to
a compromise with the Pagan deities of Mecca; others
think that the better nature of the Koreish at last caused
them to pity the famishing exiles. Whatever the facts
may be, it was discovered that the parchment on which
the edict was written had been mostly devoured by some
ants that, however, had taken devout care to leave <a id="p85"></a>the
inscribed name of God intact. The Koreish were
so confounded by this direct manifestation of Allah’s
displeasure that, when five of their leaders declared
they were opposed to the continued banishment of the
Hashimites, opposition collapsed and the weary outcasts
returned to their homes.</p>

<p>Mohammed, overjoyed at this unexpected good fortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[p. 86]</span>
and completely oblivious to the major part played
by the insects, rightly gave thanks to Allah. But new,
and even more sinister, events impended. Within a
few months death deprived him of the loyal protection
of Abu Talib and the tender ministrations of Khadija.
He comforted his wife’s dying hours with the assurance
that she, together with three other well-known women&mdash;the
Virgin Mary, Potiphar’s wife, and “Kulthum,
Moses’ sister”&mdash;would occupy his chamber in Paradise;
but all he could conscientiously promise his expiring
uncle was that he would inhabit the coolest, or at any
rate the least hot, regions in Hell. The contingent
deaths of these two made the Prophet’s position very
precarious: Khadija had constantly nerved him to face
the severest trials, and Abu Talib had just as constantly
kept the number of those trials down. Abu
Talib, in fact, was barely in his grave when the populace
of Mecca cast dust on Mohammed’s head; and he therefore
betook himself to At-Taif, a city some seventy
miles east of Mecca, to test its possibilities as a refuge.
Arriving there early in 620, he was much disconcerted
to learn that none of its inhabitants had even so much as
heard of his ten-year-old mission; and when he attempted
to enlighten them, the sheiks and their groundlings
merely sneered in open contempt. He then besought
them not to divulge his religious views&mdash;an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[p. 87]</span>
exhibition of invaliant diplomacy that caused the people
to hoot and hurl stones at him, until he fled from the
city with blood flowing down his legs. Utterly cast
down in spirit, he spent the next two months in seclusion
at Mecca. During the pilgrimage month of Dhul-Hijja,
while he was addressing the crowds of visitors
in his usual way, a coincidence of measureless significance
occurred. Mohammed chanced to notice a little
group of men whom he recognized as inhabitants of
Medina.</p>

</div>

<h3 title="Section 1">I</h3>

<p class="firstpara">Ancient Yathrib, commonly called Medina, was familiar
to the Arabs as “the pleasing” city, for it lay
in a fertile plain teeming with “green fields, running
water, every blessing the Eastern mind can desire.”
For ages it had been inhabited by expatriated Jews; but
early in the fourth century two Arab tribes, the Aus
and the Khazraj, settled there. But the Hebrew residents
were much superior to the newcomers in general
culture, in agriculture and wealth, and, it was darkly
rumored, in the black art of magic; for the Pagan
usurpers held to the primitive belief that the perfect
man was one who could write Arabic, swim and shoot&mdash;and
not many of them could write Arabic. Jealousy
of the more competent Jews, therefore, impelled the
Yathribites to make war against them, and the sons of
Abraham were decidedly disinclined to battle and bloodshed.
Accordingly, having fought the Jews with very
fair success, the two victorious clans had speedily decided
to fight each other, with the result that Medina,
for some generations, had been continually rent by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[p. 89]</span>
tribal and civil wars. At present all parties were so
tired of this everlasting strife that they had chosen one
of the chief men among the Khazraj, Abdallah ibn
Obei, to direct their fortunes; for the battle of Boath
(616) had completely exhausted all the factions involved.
Nevertheless, everybody was still dissatisfied,
since it was feared that the truce was only temporary.</p>

<p>Now, for many centuries, despite one or two notable
disappointments, the Jews had expectantly awaited the
coming of a genuine prophet&mdash;a longing that had been
communicated, probably through racial miscegenation,
even to the Aus and the Khazraj&mdash;and lo! the news of
Mohammed’s ministry was already common knowledge
at Medina. When the little troop of Medinese
chanced to meet Mohammed at the sacred fair, therefore,
they spoke thus with each other: “Know surely
that this is the prophet with whom the Jews are ever
threatening us; wherefore let us make haste and be the
first to join him.” For it was clear that languishing
Medina, long disrupted by internecine struggles,
needed above all else a leader capable of harmonizing
all discordant elements and balancing the scales of justice
impartially for all&mdash;except, it might be, the Jews&mdash;a
leader, too, who would introduce no dangerous foreign
ideas, but whose vital beliefs were grafted on a
common Arabian stock. Perhaps there was some truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[p. 90]</span>
in the saying of Mohammed’s child-wife, Ayesha, that
the battle of Boath had been engineered by Allah for
the benefit of the Moslems.</p>

<p>So, when the Prophet thus addressed the visitors,
“Sit ye down for a little, and I will speak with you,”
they gladly obeyed. After he had explained the creed
of Islam, with due emphasis upon his own part in it,
he proceeded to narrate the dangers of his position at
Mecca and next inquired what his prospects might be
at Medina. They complimented him for his exalted
rank, but expressed doubt as to his reception in their
own embattled city. “If thou comest to us thus, we
may be unable to rally round thee. Let us, we pray
thee, return unto our people, if haply the Lord will
create peace amongst us; and we will come back again
to thee at this set time next year.” So the men returned
to Medina and quickly scattered the news of
their marvelous encounter: would it not, they argued,
be good business to claim the services of this very self-confident
Messiah before he was appropriated by the
waiting Jews, whose money-lending power held the
mass of Yathribites in abject poverty?</p>

<p>This counsel appeared excellent to both the Aus and
the Khazraj. After a year of troubled waiting on the
part of Mohammed, his heart was gladdened at the sight
of twelve men who arrived on the appointed day to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span>
welcome him as the anticipated saviour of Medina.
This oath was then sworn to by all: “We will not worship
any but the one God; we will not steal, neither
will we commit adultery, nor kill our children; we will
not slander in anywise; nor will we disobey the Prophet
in anything that is right.” Mohammed was so swept
away by the general tone of obedience in this statement
that he apparently failed to notice the joker in the concluding
clause; and thus the First Pledge, or Pledge of
Women&mdash;so called because its lack of martial ardor
made it the only vow required of female Moslems&mdash;was
made. The twelve apostles at once returned and
the propagation of the new religion was soon in full
swing. At the request of the Medinese, the Prophet
sent one Musab&mdash;once a connoisseur of gaudy clothes
and delicate perfumes, but now a ragged, rampant Moslem&mdash;to
instruct them in the more intricate matters of
Islam. So tremendous was the zeal for proselytizing
that the most strenuous efforts were made to secure converts:
the newly saved souls covenanted that they would
not speak to anyone who did not acknowledge the
Prophet, and all idols, as well as idol-worshipers, were
treated with the utmost severity. The salvation of one
old fellow, who habitually bowed before a horrid image
in his house, was particularly affecting. Young devotees
cast the idol into a noisome well every night; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[p. 92]</span>
every morning he just as regularly hauled up, cleansed
it, and again went through his genuflections. One
day, however, they hitched the vile thing to a dead dog
before tossing it in the well, “whereupon he abandoned
his image and believed.” Before long new converts
came in from every side with very little persuasion; for
the Medinese were very human and, inasmuch as Islam
was now all the rage, they wanted to be in the newest
style.</p>

<p>While Medina was buzzing with these devout activities,
Mohammed was otherwise occupied. Hemmed in
by ever present dangers, and hearing only vague reports
of the conflagration that was sweeping Medina,
he was constantly on tiptoe with hopeful yet fearful
expectation. If his body was still held at Mecca, his
unbridled imagination was free to range toward the
beloved north, where both Medina and Jerusalem lay;
and one morning he astounded his townsmen by declaring
that, during the preceding night, he had performed
his devotions in the Temple of Solomon at
Jerusalem. The obliging Gabriel, he said, had borne
him on a winged steed over Medina to the Temple; the
Arabian Pegasus, however, did not pause long there,
but continued his celestial journey until he had carried
his passengers completely out of this world, to those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[p. 93]</span>
ethereal realms of bliss where the Seven Heavens lie.
Up and still up they flew, while the Prophet carefully
noted the order of precedence of those prophets whose
model he had proclaimed himself to be: Jesus and John
were in the second or third&mdash;he was not <em>quite</em> sure which&mdash;Moses
was in the sixth, while Abraham alone had the
supreme distinction of residing in the seventh. There,
at the apex of indescribable glory, Mohammed had entered
the awful presence of his Maker, Who, after some
rather pointless chit-chat, charged him to see that all
Moslems should hereafter prostrate themselves in prayer
toward the Temple of Solomon five times every day.
When Mohammed concluded, the Koreish laughed him
to scorn, and even a few of the faithful were somewhat
flabbergasted; but Abu Bekr saved the situation by declaring
that he did not doubt the truth of this tale, inasmuch
as he had already swallowed far more improbable
yarns related by the Prophet. Yet the veracity of
his amply substantiated narrative rests upon two solid
facts: from that day to this, all devout Moslems have
continued to bow themselves five times daily in prayer;
and sceptics may still see, upon the rock where stands
the Mosque of Omar in Jerusalem, the identical print
of the Prophet’s foot where he leaped upon the heavenly
charger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[p. 94]</span></p>


<h3 title="Section 2">II</h3>

<p>The year 621 glided peacefully away. Mohammed,
occupied with thoughts of a glorious future at Medina,
had lost interest in spreading the faith in Mecca; and
the Koreish, deceived by his apparent inactivity, had
largely ceased to trouble him. Musab eventually returned
with a glowing account of the progress made
at Medina; but the Prophet, whose caution was certainly
no less pronounced than his courage, carefully
guarded his enthusiasm until more definite proofs were
at hand. They soon came. In March, 622, the date
fixed for the second conclave, seventy-three Medinese
came in obedience to the promise made in the preceding
year.</p>

<p>This occasion was so profoundly important that Mohammed
took an infinitude of pains to conceal it&mdash;even
his trusted intimates did not know about it beforehand.
The Prophet, accompanied only by his wealthy and
trustworthy uncle Al-Abbas, met the delegates at dead
of night in a secluded glen. Al-Abbas diplomatically
broke the ice by stating that, while his wonderful
nephew was happy, safe and contented in Mecca, he
nevertheless preferred to establish himself at Medina&mdash;in
case ample security for his safety were assured. To
this harangue Al-Bara, leader of the visitors, replied:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[p. 95]</span>
“We have listened to thy words. Our resolution is unshaken.
Our lives are at the Prophet’s service. It is
now for <em>him</em> to speak.” Then Mohammed, beginning
loftily as he always did by chanting long passages of
the Koran, finally descended to the earth and informed
them that he would be gracious enough to confer the
boon of his presence upon Medina if its inhabitants
would make an irrevocable vow to defend him, even as
they would protect their nearest and dearest. A confused
jargon of voices arose, eagerly assuring him that
his person would be guarded at any cost. Al-Abbas,
frightened almost out of his skin, breathed: “Hush!
There may be spies abroad,” and in low tones requested
them to plight their faith. The chief replied, “Stretch
out thy hand, O Mohammed!” He did so; and Al-Bara,
followed by all the rest, struck his hand upon the
Prophet’s in token of fealty. This was called the
Second Pledge, since it included an oath to fight for
the Prophet, and the touching of his holy hand&mdash;an
honor never given to the generality of women. The assembly
then silently broke up.</p>

<p>Such a large body of men could not gather so close
to Mecca, however, without rumors leaking out. Next
morning the mistrustful chiefs of the Koreish called
upon the visitors and informed them that their presence
warranted the suspicion that they were interfering in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[p. 96]</span>
the politics of Mecca&mdash;an act that virtually amounted
to a declaration of war. The Medinese did the only
possible thing: they replied that the Koreish were
wholly mistaken, and the slow-witted Meccans were ingenuous
enough to believe them. But the clever Yathribites
had barely departed in high glee when the
Koreish learnt the facts, and set out upon a vain pursuit.
Thus foiled, the enraged Koreish at once vented
their spleen upon the believers, to whom the Prophet
accordingly gave this command: “Depart unto Medina;
for the Lord hath verily given unto you brethren
in that city, and a home in which ye may find refuge.”
Early in April the migration commenced, in parties of
twos and threes, while the baffled Koreish looked on in
stupefied amazement; for the number of clans that were
involved in the movement prevented any concerted hostilities,
since no one had the right to interfere in private
family matters. By force or guile, however, they succeeded
in corrupting some of Mohammed’s coadjutors
who were weakest in faith or family ties; but the great
body of Islam&mdash;now numbering probably close to two
hundred souls&mdash;got safely away. A royal welcome
awaited them, for the Medinese converts, flushed with
their novel fanaticism, bestowed every imaginable honor
upon the refugees&mdash;one zealot even went so far as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[p. 97]</span>
offer his guest one-half of his property, and also added
a special bounty in the shape of one of his wives.</p>

<p>But Mohammed, together with his family and the
household of Abu Bekr, still lingered. He informed
Abu that “his time was not yet come; the Lord had
not as yet given him the command to emigrate.”
Whether or no the Prophet’s decision to tarry was determined
on account of a genuine desire not to leave
the burning ship before all the passengers were safe, or
because he cannily awaited further proofs from the Medinese
before trusting his skin to them, must forever remain
a matter for indulgent speculation. But in the
middle of June he received the fearful intelligence that
the Koreish intended to visit him. Their purpose is
uncertain. It has been surmised that they had decided
to assassinate him&mdash;for if, like Cæsar, he were to be
pierced with swords driven home by representatives of
every tribe, his weak clan would have to be satisfied
with blood-money instead of blood-vengeance&mdash;to imprison
him, to ostracize him, or to do no man knows
what. That Mohammed himself was not privy to their
intentions is indicated by this passage from the Koran:
“And call to mind when the Unbelievers plotted against
thee, that they might detain thee, or slay thee, or expel
thee. Yea, they plotted, but God plotted likewise.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[p. 98]</span>
And God is the best of plotters.” Tradition states that
Gabriel informed the Prophet of the malignant design;
he at once told Ali to lie upon his bed, then went forth,
and simultaneously greeted the evil-comers with a handful
of dust and this excerpt from the Koran, “And We
have covered them so that they shall not see.” For,
indeed, the best of plotters had wrapped Mohammed in
a cloak of invisibility; he therefore escaped undetected
while the murderous men lay in wait, thinking that
the silent figure on the bed was the Prophet until the
morning light apprised them of their sad error. It
seems more likely, however, that Mohammed merely
threw his deceptive red mantle over the recumbent Ali,
and then slipped out of the back window to join the
trembling Abu Bekr, who wept joyous tears now that
his superior had at last decided to leave Mecca.</p>

<p>For the next three days, the two men lay in concealment
in a neighboring cave, while the distracted Koreish
feverishly sought everywhere for them. The house of
Abu Bekr was searched, but when his daughter Asma
was asked, “Where is thy father?” she innocently replied,
“Truly, I know not where he is”&mdash;whereupon
Abu Jahl, a ferocious and impudent fellow, “slapped
her on the face with such force that one of her earrings
dropped.” Meanwhile the two outcasts lurked
in the secrecy of the cave, across whose entrance, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[p. 99]</span>
are informed, a divinely commissioned spider wove a
protecting web; yet legends are often more industrious
than spiders. Abu Bekr would shake with fear and
breathe the low whisper, “What if one were to look
through the chink, and see us underneath his very feet?”
to which the Prophet would boldly reply: “Think not
thus, Abu Bekr! We are two, but God is in the midst
a third.” Yet Mohammed loved Abu “more than all
the world; he held no one equal unto him,” sang the
poet Hassan; and the generally taciturn and morose
Prophet, listening to the song, was pleased and laughed
so heartily that he held his sides and his back teeth became
visible. “Thou hast spoken truly, O Hassan!”
he remarked after he had recovered his breath, “it is
just as thou hast said.”</p>

<p>After three days had passed without their detection,
it seemed safe to speed toward Medina. The careful
Abu Bekr had fetched a purse, bulging with thousands
of gold pieces, as well as two of his best camels; and,
probably on the night of June 20, they mounted the
beasts&mdash;Mohammed taking care to choose the swifter
one, Al-Kaswa&mdash;and started on the perilous journey.
The two-hundred-odd miles that they must traverse
extended over a parched, barren, inexpressibly desolate
and mournful waste, where only such rugged trees as
the tamarind and acacia could exist, where phantom mirages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[p. 100]</span>
mocked the eye, and all nature was but a ribbed
and menacing skeleton. They traveled chiefly at night,
resting during the sweltering heat of the day and buying
provisions from such scattered Bedouins as they
chanced to encounter. Abu Bekr, who was well known
to most of these desert dwellers, was frequently asked
who his friend was, and he regularly made the answer,
“A guide to lead me,” while the diplomatic Prophet
kept a strict silence.</p>

<p>At length, after eight days of doubt and deprivation,
they came in sight of Medina; but the wary Mohammed
had no intention of trusting himself to the city before
he knew exactly how things lay. “Lead us,” he said to
the guide, “straight to the Beni Amr at Koba, and
draw not yet nigh unto Medina.” This overscrupulous
vigilance turned out to be unnecessary, for
rumors of his approach had set the city agog with delight;
and every morning a band of converts and refugees
had posted themselves on a hill to watch his arrival.
On this morning one of them, catching sight of
the travelers as they trudged toward Koba, raised the
rapturous shout: “Ho! he has come! he whom we have
been looking for has come!” The marvelous news flew
from tongue to tongue, and everybody rushed forth to
Koba to greet the majestic guest. Even the children
cried out: “Here is the Prophet! He is come! He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[p. 101]</span>
is come!” while a great crowd surged around him and
made profound obeisance. Then Mohammed knew at
last that he was safe among friends. He had escaped
from Mecca, where the Koreishite swords might have
altered the course of events for all time; but the otherwise
dull and sluggish Middle Ages were fated to be
infinitely enriched by the romantic contest between the
Crescent and the Cross. “Ye people!” he courteously
proclaimed, “show your joy by giving your neighbors
the salutation of peace; send portions to the poor; bind
close the ties of kinsmanship; and offer up your prayers
whilst others sleep. Thus ye shall enter Paradise in
peace.”</p>


<h3 title="Section 3">III</h3>

<p>To make the assurance of a safe entrance to Medina
doubly sure, however, Mohammed lingered four days
at Koba. Even then he took no dangerous chances,
for he requested the Medinese descendants of his revered
great-grandmother, the spouse of Hashim, to attend
him into the city; and in the meantime he had slept
only when some of his most trusted underlings kept
watch. These super-precautions proved to be needless,
for tribe after tribe came flocking forth to see
which could outdo the other in paying reverence to him.
On every hand rose the earnest request: “Alight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[p. 102]</span>
here, O Prophet! We have abundance with us, means
of defense and weapons and room. Abide with us!”&mdash;and
many suppliants emphasized their requests by
seizing the halter of Al-Kaswa. On this occasion Mohammed’s
superb political ability was again evidenced.
He would show no favoritism, but, by means of a camel
and an omen&mdash;both inexpressibly dear to every Arab’s
heart&mdash;he would choose his abode by supernatural
means. To all these fervent ejaculations he replied:
“The decision rests with the camel; make way for her;
let her go free.” So Al-Kaswa, unguided by rein,
moved forward until she entered the eastern section of
the city, where, seeing a few date-trees in an open courtyard,
she quite naturally ambled toward their grateful
shade and awkwardly sat down. And in this way
was the site for the Mosque chosen&mdash;the famous Mosque
where, for the remainder of his days, the Prophet dwelt,
married, prayed, preached, emitted new revelations,
planned his schemes of conquest, greeted his friends,
and uttered maledictions against his foes; where, also,
he sickened, died and was buried. Yet certain abominable
sceptics have intimated that Mohammed knew
beforehand that this particular spot was already hallowed
as a place of prayer, and that the rein of Al-Kaswa’s
halter was not so very slack after all.</p>

<p>The Prophet at once negotiated to buy the sacred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[p. 103]</span>
site. Its owners wished to make him a present of it,
but he would not stoop to accept it as a gift; accordingly,
it was purchased with ten gold pieces from Abu
Bekr’s wallet. For seven months Mohammed lived in
the lower story of an adjacent house, owned by Abu
Eiyub, while the construction of the Mosque, with its
adjoining apartments for himself, went on. His bodily
wants were provided for by the citizens, who contended
with each other for the honor of sending him the
choicest viands they could procure. As might be expected,
Abu Eiyub was exceedingly solicitous for the
comfort and safety of his distinguished roomer. Once,
when a water-pot was accidentally broken in the upper
story, Abu and his wife quickly sopped up the water
with their clothes, and then rushed down to Mohammed’s
apartment in great fear lest a drop or two might
have defiled his garments. Meanwhile the building of
the Mosque was pushed at full speed. The Prophet
himself joined heartily in the work, thus stimulating all
his helpers to increase their efforts, and united with
them in their labor-lightening song:</p>

more firm, Mohammed, after first setting the example,
paired off individuals in each. “Become brethren
every two and two of you,” he gently commanded, and
it was done.</p>

<p>One danger, unforeseen even by the perspicacious
Prophet, soon threatened the refugees. The climate
of Mecca, while excessively hot, was dry and salubrious;
but, though Medina’s altitude was unusually great, her
drainage paradoxically enough was very poor, and the
noxious exhalations from her stagnant water, abetted
by intense heat at day and intense cold at night, soon
prostrated large numbers of the refugees with fever.
This misfortune so dampened the enthusiasm of many
that, in their frenzied delirium, they would moan out
their desire to go home. When Mohammed heard of
this, he looked upward and raised this prayer: “O
Lord! make Medina dear unto us, even as Mecca, or
even dearer. Bless its produce, and banish far from
it the pestilence!” But, for some inscrutable reason,
Allah, the Hearer and the Answerer of Prayer, remained
deaf for a time; and at one period Mohammed
was one of the very few persons who were able to stand
during prayers. When, however, he informed the recumbent
invalids that “the prayer of one who sits is
worth only half the prayer of him that stands,” they all
made desperate efforts to rise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[p. 105]</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the first few months at Medina were
on the whole happy and auspicious. The elements of
disaffection that lurked among the Jews and the unbelievers
bided their day; the refugees and the citizen converts,
or allies, gladly rushed to fulfill the smallest
desire of the Prophet, whose fascinating personality
completely charmed his friends and even intrigued his
enemies&mdash;for a time. Who could resist the appeal of
a man who gracefully bestowed names of good omen
upon converts previously burdened with inauspicious
Pagan titles, and who dignified those of his subordinates
who were enslaved in the ignoble calling of
“hucksters” by altering the forbidding word to “Merchants”?
In an excess of praiseworthy devotion, they
quaffed the sacred water in which the Prophet had
bathed, and piously treasured his hairs and nail-parings
as charms and forget-me-nots. And Mohammed, ever
extraordinarily swift to take hints, soon formed the
habit of wrapping up these personal relics and bestowing
them upon new converts as a peculiar evidence of
his esteem.</p>

<p>While his worshipers thus fawned and his foes maintained
an ominously quiet peace, the Prophet calmly
assumed the attributes of a sovereign and sacerdotal
office. As self-appointed ruler of the city, he exercised
the right of deposing and selecting whatever chiefs he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[p. 106]</span>
desired; as priestly dictator of all Islam, he established
those multitudinous rules and ordinances that still defy
the assaults of time. Motivated probably by a statesmanlike,
if rather cautious, wish to win or at least placate
the Jews, he inaugurated a complicated system of
devotion based principally upon the famous precepts
that had been given to Moses. The detractors of Islam
have so exaggerated its largely fictitious sensuality that
its rigorous rites have too often been forgotten: its lustrations,
its fastings, its prodigality of genuflections.
The business of lustration, for example, was very complicated.
Before prayer the Moslem must wash his
face from the top of the forehead to the chin and sideways
as far as both ears, bathe his arms and hands as
far as the elbows, and cleanse his feet as far as the
ankles; and all this must be done in the strictest silence,
broken only by such prayers as the votary might think
appropriate. While scrubbing his teeth, he might say
if he chose: “Vouchsafe, O Lord, as I clean my teeth,
to purify me from my faults, and accept my homage,
O Lord! May the purity of my teeth be for me a
pledge of the whiteness of my face at the Day of Judgment.”
If, through a momentary lapse into sin, the
hapless believer had defiled his body, he thus washed
away his iniquity: three successive times he poured water
upon his right and left shoulders, and a like number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span>
of times on the top of his head; and should one
hair on the entire body be left untouched, the act of
purification was wholly vain.</p>

<p>The Prophet also instituted various fasts which, with
certain alterations, have also endured. These fasts
were, if possible, even more laboriously meticulous than
lustration. While abstaining from food and drink, the
Moslems must take the most scrupulous precaution to
see that absolutely nothing entered the body. If they
smelled perfumes, bathed, or carelessly swallowed their
spittle, the fast was broken; the most ardent disciples
would not even open their mouths to converse, for fear
of inhaling too much air; and, if a thoughtless faster
allowed a particle of food, no matter how small, to become
wedged between his teeth, he was deemed to be a
backslider from the faith.</p>

<p>December was for a time annually sanctified by fasting,
and several rather diverting details followed. In
the first place, most of the Moslems took the responsibility
with such complete and abject seriousness that
they unintentionally disturbed the Prophet’s slumbers.
Very late one evening they came to the Mosque for the
service of prayer; and, observing that Mohammed was
not on hand, they approached his house and coughed
loudly before the door. The Prophet, now thoroughly
aroused, came forth and addressed them thus: “I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[p. 108]</span>
observed for some days your coming for the nightly
prayer at the Mosque, until I feared that it would grow
by custom into a binding ordinance.... Wherefore,
pray ye at eventide in your houses.” He then returned
to resume his interrupted repose; but a further trouble
awaited him. His humble supporters, it appeared,
were obsessed with the monkish idea that they should
abstain from every conceivable pleasure during the
whole month; but Mohammed was too wise to permit
such immoderate asceticism. Allah, it was soon revealed,
“willeth not for you that which is difficult....
It is lawful unto you, during the nights of the Fast,
to consort with your wives. Now, therefore, sleep with
them, and earnestly desire that which God hath ordained
for you; and eat and drink until ye can distinguish
a white thread from a black thread, by the daybreak.
Then keep the fast again until night....
Thus God declareth His signs unto mankind, that they
may follow Piety.” The consequent popularity of the
fast, indeed, brought new adherents to Islam in great
abundance, until an unforeseen contingency arose.
Abstinence from food and drink during the short days
of December caused little difficulty; but the Prophet,
trusting in that quaint omniscience which universally
attends the assumption of prophetic robes, introduced
an intercalary system based upon the lunar months.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[p. 109]</span>
The sacred month, therefore, gradually shifted from
winter to summer, when the sixteen-hour days made
what had previously been a pleasure a great burden;
nevertheless, Mohammed persevered in his oddity, for
to have done otherwise would have impugned his infallibility.
So his faithful zealots groaned and were
troubled, and longingly anticipated the new moon,
when the fast was joyously broken by the bestowal of
alms upon the poor and the resumption of normal
bodily activities.</p>

<p>Five times a day the believers, no matter how pleasantly
occupied, must turn to prayer: at dawn, at midday,
in the afternoon, at sunset, and at the coming of
complete darkness. On six days these devotions could
be performed anywhere, though preferably in congregation
at the Mosque; but every Friday the Moslems,
unless detained by extraordinary causes, were commanded
to worship in a body at the Mosque. The ever
efficient Gabriel informed Mohammed of Allah’s desire
that the time for each prayer should be announced by
a crier, who must shout: “<span class="smcap">Great is the Lord!
Great is the Lord!</span> I bear witness that there is no
God but the Lord: I bear witness that Mohammed is
the Prophet of God. Come unto prayer: come unto
salvation. God is great! God is great! There is no
God but the Lord!” So Mohammed instructed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[p. 110]</span>
negro servant, Bilal, to be the public crier; and early
every morning Bilal would clamber upon a high house
and rouse the slumbering Moslems with these words,
adding this salutary invention of his own: “Prayer is
better than sleep! Prayer is better than sleep!”
Then, climbing down from his lofty perch, he would
approach Mohammed’s door and shout: “To prayer,
O Apostle of God! to salvation!”</p>

<p>At the special Friday service, the Prophet ascended
the pulpit, gave a stereotyped salutation of peace, and
then seated himself while Bilal shouted the stentorian
summons to prayer. Descending from the pulpit, Mohammed
then led the prayers; reascending, he delivered
one or two exhortations. The assembly, fixing their
rapt glances on his earnest gesticulations, would swallow
every word and at the end join in a loud “Amen!”
or something like it. When all was over, his mantle of
striped material from Yemen, and his girdle of splendid
Oman cloth, were carefully folded up and laid away
until the next service. The pulpit itself was soon endowed
with an awful sanctity. Disputes were settled
at its base; and should anyone take a false oath in its
presence, “even if the subject were as insignificant as a
toothpick”&mdash;and toothpicks were not wholly unknown
in Islam&mdash;he thereby doomed himself to eternal damnation.
Before it had been built, Mohammed had supported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[p. 111]</span>
himself during his sermons by leaning on a post&mdash;an
object of which he grew so fond that, after it was
no longer needed, he commanded it should be interred
beneath the pulpit. The post itself reciprocated his
touching sentiment; for, when it was abandoned, it
moaned loudly and would not stop until the Prophet
placed his hand upon it, whereupon its grief was assuaged.</p>

<h3 title="Section 1">I</h3>

<p class="firstpara">Though Mohammed was now actually the spiritual
and nominally the temporal ruler of Medina, his position
nevertheless was very precarious. The Jews, while
completely deficient in martial valor, were openly contemptuous
of his prophetical jurisdiction, and the Khazrajite
leader, Abdallah ibn Obei, showed overt defiance
against his assumption of civil power. Presumably because
he feared and respected Abdallah’s influence, the
Prophet took pains to treat him with every courtesy;
but the compliment was not returned. One day, when
Mohammed chanced to observe his rival seated at ease
in the cool shade of his house, he alighted from his steed,
graciously saluted the sitter, recited some of the most
affecting passages in the Koran, and finally invited
him to adopt the faith. Abdallah listened composedly
until the long harangue was ended; then he spoke.
“Nothing could be better than this discourse of thine,
if it were true. Now, therefore, do thou sit at home in
thine own house, and whosoever cometh to thee preach
thus unto him, and he that cometh not unto thee refrain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[p. 113]</span>
from troubling him with that which he dislikes.” He
also casually mentioned the fact that he objected to the
smell of the beast that Mohammed bestrode; so the
Prophet went on his way, sorely stricken in spirit.</p>

<p>In other ways, too, he was equally unfortunate. His
fabulous rise from the lowly state of an insignificant
trader to the pinnacle of fame appears to have induced
him to overestimate his powers; at any rate, soon after
his arrival at Medina, he betrayed his ignorance of the
simplest facts of Arabian agriculture by forbidding the
artificial fecundation of palm trees, with the result that
they became almost barren. But when his egregious
error was pointed out, he manifested a wisdom rare in
prophets by candidly admitting that he was in the
wrong. “I am only mortal,” he confessed. “If I give
you an order in the domain of your religion then receive
it; but if I give you an order from my own opinion
then am I but mortal.” In the near famine that had
resulted from his bungling interference, there was poetic
justice in the fact that he, as well as the rest, could
eat only one date per day; yet he gladly shared in the
stringent privations that all were forced to endure.
While his own face was pinched with hunger, he divided
with the most needy Moslems the gifts of food
which various people had sent him; on one occasion he
was glad to accept a Jew’s offer to partake of a meal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[p. 114]</span>
of rancid fat and barley bread; and for months, during
the dead of winter, he went without any fire on his
hearth.</p>

<p>It was obvious that such a state of affairs could not
be permitted to continue. No matter how strong the
already sorely tried faith of his partisans was, it would
not forever withstand the shocks of rampant famine and
naked, shivering misery; then too, and even more vital,
was the consideration that new converts could never be
won over to such a ragged and unkempt faith&mdash;Islam
would not grow. And other even more subtle ideas
were fermenting in Mohammed’s ever restive mind.
He, the one and only Prophet of the Most High Allah,
was a starving outcast because of the pernicious activities
of the overbearing, wealthy and rather cowardly
Koreish, whose teeming caravans pursued their unmolested
way northward from Mecca, between Medina
and the Red Sea, to Syria. But the destitute refugees
were pledged to advance the banners of Islam not
merely in defensive, but, if Allah so willed, in offensive
war; and should any of them see fit to remind him that,
in earlier days, he had instructed them not to retaliate
against their enemies, he could&mdash;and did&mdash;allay their
squeamishness with a revelation. Furthermore, his
henchmen had already been subjected, by chance or design,
to a strenuous discipline that had inured them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span>
endure such hardships as a career of pillage and guerrilla
warfare would entail. Rigid religious fasts had
accustomed them to withstand hunger and thirst; at
the daily public <i lang="ar">salat</i>, or prayer, they had been drilled
to stand in rows, to perform what amounted to tough
gymnastic exercises, and to expect celestial condemnation
unless they scrupulously obeyed the minutest requirements
of these incessant manœuvers. The successful
plundering of opulent Koreishite caravans&mdash;which,
under the circumstances, might reasonably be expected&mdash;would
accomplish four excellent results: it
would put a summary end to the ubiquitous suffering at
Medina; it would provide a more than adequate outlet
for the explosive zeal of his backers; it would conclusively
demonstrate the prowess of Islam, thereby
winning new members to the fold; and it would enable
Mohammed to exult over the salutary discomfiture of
his despicable foes.</p>

<p>How clearly defined these or other considerations may
have been in the mind of the outstanding Oriental of
the seventh century, it would be presumptuous for a
twentieth century Occidental to say; the fact remains,
however, that such were the results attained. Brahminism,
Buddhism and Confucianism waxed slowly
great through renunciation, inertia and mystical contemplation;
but Jehovah and Allah were made of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[p. 116]</span>
sterner stuff. It seems probable that, despite the peaceful
creed and practice of its founder, Christianity would
never have become a serious rival of other world-faiths
had it not been for the implacable swords of Constantine
and Charlemagne; but Islam was fortunate from
the beginning in that its inventor entertained no silly
scruples about blood-letting. The Crusades, the
French Revolution, and Cromwellian Puritanism were
attended by an amount of sadism that may well make
one pause before too severely condemning the blood-mania
and sex-obsession that mark every stage of
Islam’s triumphant progress.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that, from December, 622, until
October, 623, the Prophet sent six separate expeditions
against the Meccan caravans. The first three were entirely
unsuccessful, notwithstanding the fact that Mohammed
presented the leader of each one with a white
banner mounted on a staff; but the fourth, led by the
Prophet himself, was marked by a momentous incident.
Though he failed to capture his prey, he made some
sort of offensive and defensive alliance with the idolatrous
tribe of Banu Damrah; and, apparently lest he
might be rightly criticized for making friends with unbelievers,
he justified his action in the only acceptable
way&mdash;by a revelation. “It may be that Allah will
bring about friendship between you and those whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[p. 117]</span>
you hold to be your enemies.... Allah does not forbid
you respecting those who have not made war against
you on account of (your) religion, and have not driven
you forth from your homes.... Allah only forbids
you respecting those who made war against you on
account of (your) religion, and drove you forth from
your homes....” It may be surmised that the
Prophet, himself an ex-camel-driver familiar with Bedouin
ways, was moved to speak thus by two considerations:
desert tribes that subsisted principally by plunder
would be quick to appreciate the desirability of linking
themselves with a faith that sanctified theft here and
promised Paradise hereafter; besides, a successful assault
on Koreish merchandise could hardly be made
without the acquiescence or assistance of the tribes
through whose territory that merchandise passed.</p>

<p>The fifth expedition was fruitless, but the sixth
brought about alliances with several seashore clans; and
a seventh one led not only to the first actual bloodshed,
but to an even more striking innovation. Two days
before the end of the sacred month of Rejeb, Mohammed
sent eight men forth and gave their leader sealed
orders which were not to be opened until after a two
days’ march. By a mere coincidence or by a sly design
of the Prophet, the document was thus read, according
to instructions, on the last day of Rejeb. After commanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[p. 118]</span>
the leader not to force “any of thy followers
against his inclination,” it ordered him to lie in wait
for a Meccan caravan. Faced by the dilemma of fighting
when strife was taboo, or of delaying until it would
be too late to overtake the Koreish travelers, the Moslems
summarily solved the problem by shooting an arrow
through one of the Meccans and returning to
Medina with the booty. Then, to their utter dismay,
Mohammed rose up, “his face red with anger,” and declared,
“I never commanded thee to fight in the Sacred
month.” Yet it is curiously interesting to note that
this heavenly message soon appeared: “They will ask
thee concerning the Sacred months, whether they may
war therein. Say: Warring therein is grievous; but
to obstruct the way of God and to deny Him, to hinder
men from the Holy temple, and to expel His people
thence, that is more grievous with God.”</p>

<p>Thus, through blind caprice or far-seeing, statesmanlike
duplicity, the way was opened for bloodshed on a
grand and wholly unrestricted scale. Nine centuries
before Machiavelli, and eleven before Napoleon, the
Prophet of Islam formulated this dictum: “War after
all is but a game of deception.” Deception of several
kinds, that is to say: one’s foes should be openly cursed
and belittled while privately they were respected and
even feared; one’s followers should be assured that martial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[p. 119]</span>
ardor was the best of all possible virtues and that
death on the field of honor was a matchless boon. “The
sword,” Mohammed declared, “is the key of Heaven
and Hell; a drop of blood shed in the cause of God, a
night spent in arms, is of more avail than two months
of fasting or prayer; whosoever falls in battle, his
sins are forgiven; at the day of judgment his wounds
shall be resplendent as vermilion, and odiferous as
musk; and the loss of his limbs shall be supplied by the
wings of angels and cherubim.” The Koran of this
period teems with frightful maledictions against the
Koreish, and transcendent pictures of the Paradise that
awaited the Moslem elect. Those warriors who could
repeat the greatest number of its verses were, we are
told, rewarded with the pick of the spoil after a victorious
contest, and those who fell martyrs to Islam were
buried with the most honorable rites. It was only too
easy, one suspects, for devout Moslem warriors to memorize
such passages as these: “War is ordained for
you, even if it be irksome unto you. Perchance ye may
dislike that which is good for you, and love that which is
evil for you. But God knoweth, and ye know not....
God loveth not the Transgressors. Kill them wheresoever
ye find them; and expel them from whence they
have expelled you.... Those of you that contribute
before the victory, and fight, shall not be placed on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[p. 120]</span>
the same level, but shall have a rank superior over those
who contribute after it and fight. Who is he that lendeth
unto the Lord a goodly loan? He shall double the
same, and he shall have honorable recompense....
Those that have gone into exile for the cause of God,
and then have been slain, or have died, We shall certainly
nourish them with an excellent provision, for God
is the best Provider.... He shall lead them into the
Paradise whereof He hath told them.... For ever
therein&mdash;a fair abode and resting place!”</p>


<h3 title="Section 2">II</h3>

<p>So it came to pass that the Prophet, who had managed
to survive at Mecca only because of the Koreishite
respect for ties of blood, was himself responsible for
starting a blood-feud against the Koreish. He appears,
however, to have been far less disturbed by this
consideration than by the fact that he had not yet succeeded
in winning any considerable amount of loot
from them; but his desire was soon to be amply gratified.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 623, Abu Sufyan, a leading Meccan
merchant, had conducted the most important caravan
of the year to Syria, and in January, 624, he was
on his way home with fifty thousand pieces of gold.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[p. 121]</span>
Mohammed had meanwhile determined that this rich
cargo should be his; but, being yet somewhat inexperienced
in the niceties of brigandage and slaughter, he
carelessly allowed rumors of his intention to reach the
ears of Abu, who at once sent a runner to Mecca with an
urgent request for a rescuing force. The Prophet, in
the meanwhile, rallied his supporters for the assault
after this fashion: “See! here cometh a caravan of
Koreish in which they have embarked much wealth.
Come! let us go forth; peradventure the Lord will enrich
us with the same.” Scores of refugees and citizens
gladly leaped forth to obey, but he would allow none
save the righteous to join him. Chancing to spy two
heathens among the volunteers, he sternly addressed
them thus, “None shall go forth with me but he who is
of our Faith.” To their plea that they were redoubtable
fighters who would ask nothing but their share of
the plunder, he replied: “Ye shall not go thus. <em>Believe
and fight!</em>” Immediately they asserted their profound
conviction that he was indeed the Prophet of Allah,
whereupon their ears were gladdened with the remark,
“Now go forth and fight!” And these two became
such famous despoilers that another heathen, after
noting how greatly their conversion had benefited them,
sadly exclaimed: “Would that I had gone forth with
the Prophet! Then I had surely secured large booty!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[p. 122]</span></p>

<p>After dispatching two scouts to watch the movements
of the caravan, Mohammed and his army of three hundred
and five men at once set out toward Bedr (a spot
near the coast to the southwest of Medina), hoping to
apprehend the caravan at that place. While on the
way, he deliberately avoided passing through certain
localities whose names were unpleasing to him; for this
singular man, who commonly appeared morose, taciturn
and phlegmatic, had a nervous temperament that
was extraordinarily susceptible to an astonishing variety
of idiosyncratic fancies and whims. He would not
sit down at night in a dark room; he believed that odd
numbers had greater virtue than even ones; he changed
color and walked nervously around during heavy
storms; and he had a charmingly ingenuous faith in
portents. Abu Sufyan, too, believed in signs&mdash;when
they meant something definite. When he came to a
well at Bedr, his eagle eyes spied two ominous date-stones
that the careless scouts had dropped near its
brink. “Camels from Yathrib!” cried Abu; “these be
the scouts of Mohammed!” and he immediately guided
his caravan at full speed to the right.</p>

<p>His runner meanwhile had reached Mecca where, approaching
the Kaba, he forced his camel to kneel; then,
cutting off its nose and ears and tearing his shirt-tails
to signify that a dreadful calamity impended, the Arabian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[p. 123]</span>
Paul Revere screamed: “Koreish! Koreish! your
caravan is pursued by Mohammed. Help! oh help!”
The Meccans, already enraged at the murder of their
tribesman at the hands of Moslems during Rejeb, were
more than eager for vengeance, and an army of about
nine hundred and fifty men at once started for Bedr.
But, when they neared that place, a messenger reached
them with the news that the caravan had fled on and
was already out of danger. A heated discussion arose
as to what should be done: since their merchandise was
safe, should they return; or, should they take up the
presumptuous challenge of the renegade Prophet?
While both points of view were being violently argued,
another scout came rushing up with the appalling information
that the Moslem “numbers are small, but
death is astride upon the camels of Yathrib.” Following
this alarming prophecy, a retreat had almost been
ordered when Abu Jahl, the nasty girl-slapper, taunted
his compatriots by calling them cowards, and bade one
Amir, a brother of the murdered Meccan, to think of
his brother-blood; Amir immediately tore off his garments,
covered himself with dust and began to shriek
his brother’s name aloud. Thus their fury was revived,
and, though a few craven-hearted ones returned
to Mecca, the rest marched posthaste toward the oncoming
foe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[p. 124]</span></p>

<p>During this time the news of the enemy’s advance had
reached the army of Mohammed; but, instead of causing
debate, it had roused the Moslem enthusiasm to a
greater pitch. The citizens, too, even though they had
not pledged themselves to assist in offensive warfare,
were equally affected. “Prophet of the Lord!” shouted
their leader, “march whither thou listest; encamp wheresoever
thou mayest choose; make war or conclude peace
with whom thou wilt. For I swear by Him who hath
sent thee the Truth, that if thou wert to march till our
camels fell down dead, we should go forward with thee
to the world’s end.” Then Mohammed, deeply affected
by this proof of devotion, responded: “Go forward
with the blessing of God! For, verily, He hath
promised one of the two&mdash;the army or the caravan&mdash;that
He will deliver it into our hands. By the Lord!
methinks I even now see the battlefield strewn with
dead.” Here were no timid bickerings, no half-hearted
counsels, no unmanly scruples about spilling fraternal
blood: what <em>was</em> there to fear when Paradise, revenge
for ostracism, and fifty thousand shining pieces of gold
beckoned them on? And the Prophet, who never did
things by halves, fanned the rising fires of fanaticism
by giving turbulent utterance to a series of commingled
imprecatory and suppliant prayers. “O Lord! let not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[p. 125]</span>
Abu Jahl escape, the Pharaoh of his people! Lord!
let not Zaama escape; rather let the eyes of his father
run sore for him with weeping, and become blind!...
O Lord! I beseech thee, forget not Thy promise of assistance
and of victory. O Lord! if this little band be
vanquished, Idolatry will prevail, and the pure worship
of Thee cease from off the earth!”</p>

<p>When night fell, both armies had nearly reached
Bedr. Mohammed and Abu Bekr sought repose in a
hut of palm branches guarded by a soldier with his
sword drawn; and the Prophet’s slumbers were comforted
by dreams in which the enemy appeared as a pitifully
weak force. Morning had barely dawned when
foe swiftly advanced to meet foe. A providential rain
had softened the ground over which the Koreish must
needs pass, and, at the same time, it had paradoxically
hardened the soil beneath the Moslem feet; the fortunate
fact that small sandy ridges concealed the majority
of the Meccans induced the Medinese to advance
with extra courage; and the Koreish suffered the further
disadvantage of facing the troublesome rays of
the rising sun. In addition, the Prophet’s superior
foresight, abetted by the suggestion of a counselor, had
prompted him to take possession of a never-failing
spring, as well as to destroy all the other available water-sources;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[p. 126]</span>
for he always backed up his incessant prayers
by using every device of military tactics that he happened
to know, or acquire.</p>

<p>According to the Arabian custom, the fray opened
with a series of individual combats. Three Meccan
warriors stepped vaingloriously forth, daring the three
best men among the Moslems to face them; and valorous
Hamza, impetuous Ali, and Obeida the septuagenarian
rushed forward to accept the challenge. The
swords of Hamza and Ali soon dripped with the lifeblood
of two Koreishites; when Obeida fell severely
wounded, they sprang to his aid and simultaneously delivered
two lusty strokes that killed the third. Then,
raising the cry, “Ye conquerors, strike!” the serried
Moslem ranks hurled themselves against the enemy;
but the Prophet himself, while the deadly yet indecisive
struggle was being waged, played an ambiguous part.
Friendly traditions state that he bounded about with a
sword in his hand. Those of another sort relate that,
upon observing the first shedding of blood, he retired to
his hut and swooned; that, upon being revived, he
poured forth the most energetic prayers; and that, even
before the battle commenced, he had taken pains to have
a swift camel tied to his tent as a last resource against
the possible calamity of defeat. Still other narratives
assert that he occupied himself principally in reminding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[p. 127]</span>
his accomplices that Paradise awaited those who perished
for Islam&mdash;a promise whose validity he himself
seems to have been indisposed to test. For Mohammed,
no less than many other religiously-minded emperors
and tsars, appears to have conducted himself in battle
according to the wise principle that a head without a
halo is infinitely more desirable than a halo without a
head.</p>

<p>While the disorderly Meccan forces were being steadily
pressed back by the close-joined Moslem ranks, a
furious storm of wind arose. Until this time, Mohammed
seems to have been rather sceptical concerning the
issue of his prayers; but, now that the foe was beginning
to waver, he doubted no longer. “That,” he exclaimed
while the tempest raged, “is Gabriel with a
thousand angels charging down upon the foe.” Then,
stooping and grabbing up a handful of small stones,
he rose and hurled them at the Koreish, accompanying
his action with the shout, “Confusion seize their faces!”
This double assault, timed at the psychological moment,
could not fail to have effect. The broken and shaken
Meccan ranks&mdash;thoroughly discomfited by a lack of
discipline, by a merely lukewarm interest in fighting
their quondam neighbors and friends, and, as their
own satirists abundantly pointed out later, by actual
cowardice&mdash;cracked apart and fled in complete dismay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[p. 128]</span>
to be harassed and killed or captured by the pursuing
Moslems. Mohammed lost but fourteen men in the
encounter, whereas more than a hundred Koreish were
slain or taken prisoners.</p>

<p>Curious scenes followed. A Moslem named Moadh
had succeeded in cutting off Abu Jahl’s leg. Just then
Moadh, attacked by Abu’s son, had found himself with
one of his own arms almost severed; and, realizing that
this member was now a useless impediment, Moadh bent
over, placed his foot on the injured arm, wrenched it
off, and continued to fight. At this moment one Abdallah
came running up to assist Moadh, and, overjoyed
at his good fortune in stumbling over such a notorious
enemy, cut off Abu Jahl’s head and carried it
to Mohammed. The Prophet, who was just beginning
to celebrate his victory, raised the exultant shout:
“The head of the enemy of God! God! there is none
other God!” “There is none other!” agreed Abdallah,
dropping his gory prize before Mohammed’s feet; and
Abdallah almost fainted from bliss when the Prophet
continued, “It is more acceptable to me than the choicest
camel in all Arabia.” It happened, also, that Ali
had overheard Mohammed praying for the death of
Naufal ibn Khuweilid, who had been taken prisoner;
so Ali ran up, coolly slaughtered him, and promptly
hastened with the good news to the Prophet, who joyously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[p. 129]</span>
commented that this was doubtless a direct answer
to his supplication. The spoil was soon gathered, and
a pit was dug into which the Koreishite bodies were
tossed; and Mohammed, who stood by watching the proceedings,
greeted each corpse by name, adding this question,
“Have ye now found true that which your Lord
did promise you? What my Lord promised me, that
verily I have found to be true.” “O Prophet!” inquired
an amazed observer, “dost thou speak unto the dead?”
“Yea, verily,” was the reply, “for now they well know
that the promise of their Lord hath fully come to pass.”</p>

<p>Next morning, when the prisoners were led before
him, he turned a malignant gaze upon Al-Nadr, who
had been captured by Mikdad. “There is death in that
glance,” the frightened Al-Nadr whispered to a bystander,
and he was right; his trembling plea for mercy
was rewarded with the response, “Islam hath rent all
bonds asunder,” from a prominent Moslem, and with
the command, “Strike off his head!” from Mohammed,
who also felt moved to add, “And, O Lord, do Thou of
Thy bounty grant unto Mikdad a better prey than
this!” Another prisoner, Okba&mdash;a man well versed in
Grecian, Persian and Arabian lore, who is said to have
aroused the Prophet’s ire by the observation that, if a
fund of good stories entitled a man to call himself a
prophet, he was fully as good a candidate as Mohammed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[p. 130]</span>
himself&mdash;was likewise ordered to face his doom. Mohammed,
however, first satisfied Okba’s curiosity as to
why he had been singled out for destruction with the
words, “Because of thine enmity to God and his
Prophet.” “And my little girl,” continued Okba, “who
will take care of her?” “Hell-fire!” was the swift reply,
as Okba was chopped to the ground. The Prophet,
surveying the remains, rejoiced after this fashion: “I
give thanks unto the Lord that hath slain thee, and comforted
mine eyes thereby.” Yet it should be stated that
the defenders of Islam asseverate that Mohammed’s remarks
to the Koreishite corpses were intended to express
pity rather than hatred, and that the ejaculation “Hell-fire!”
was a reference to the fact that Okba’s children
were nicknamed “children of fire”&mdash;in other words, he
implied that Okba’s descendants would be cared for by
his relatives.</p>

<p>Whatever the facts may be, it is certain that Mohammed
treated the rest of the captives with a kindness
rarely matched in the martial history of Arabia. While
the implacable Omar made a violent plea for their summary
death, and while the easy-going Abu Bekr urged
clemency, Gabriel winged his way from Allah’s presence
with the gratifying information that Mohammed might
do as he wished; but he added the portentous remark
that, if the Koreish were spared, a like number of Moslems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[p. 131]</span>
would perish in battle within the year. Mohammed
eventually pleased everyone, except Omar, by announcing
that the prisoners would not be slain, but
that they could be freed only by ransom, and that those
Moslems who might fall as Gabriel had foretold would
“inherit Paradise and the <a id="p131"></a>crown of martyrdom.” His
decision was probably reached on account of several
considerations: the ransom for some seventy prisoners
might benefit Islam even more than their blood; there
was the further chance that some of them might become
disciples; and, finally, he may conceivably have been
more mercifully minded than his traducers admit.</p>

<p>Joy and thanksgiving were unbounded when the news
of the overwhelming victory reached Medina; even the
toddling children chased around the streets crying out,
“Abu Jahl, the sinner, is slain!” The prisoners were so
kindly treated that some of them actually became converts,
while the stubborn remainder were ransomed for
reasonable sums&mdash;except those whose wealth Mohammed’s
abnormally retentive memory still kept in mind.
Thus, when the case of the opulent Naufal, Mohammed’s
own cousin, came up, the Prophet amazed him
with a demand for the thousand spears that he possessed;
Naufal was so completely upset by this evidence
of what appeared to be supernatural assistance that he
is said to have accepted Islam on the spot. Among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[p. 132]</span>
prisoners, also, was the Prophet’s rich uncle Al-Abbas,
who declined to pay on the ground that he was already
a Moslem and that he had been obliged to fight against
his conscience. “God knows best about that,” replied
his nephew; “externally you were against us, so ransom
yourself.” When Al-Abbas demurred, saying that he
was now penniless, he was met with the pitiless query,
“Then where is the money which, when you left Mecca,
you secretly deposited with your wife?” Al-Abbas
paid his ransom. Meanwhile a spirited discussion arose
as to the way in which the booty&mdash;which included about
one hundred and fifty camels and horses, together with
vast quantities of vestments and armor&mdash;should be divided;
the matter, indeed, was so important that it could
be settled only by a heavenly decree, which stipulated
that one-fifth should be placed at the disposal of “God
and the Prophet” and the remainder equally dispersed
among the army.</p>

<p>But these were mere mercenary considerations. The
outstanding, overshadowing fact was that a small body
of Moslems had utterly routed a force three times their
own number. Mohammed might well claim that he had
at last performed a veritable miracle, and his subordinates
might well have become a little vainglorious too;
but the Koran soon placed the credit for the “Day of
Deliverance” where it properly belonged. “As for victory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[p. 133]</span>
it is from none other than from God; for God is
glorious and wise.... And ye slew them not, but God
slew them. Neither was it thou, O Prophet, that didst
cast the gravel; but God did cast it.” And yet the human
side of the encounter was not neglected. The
glorious Three Hundred who had fought and conquered
such superior odds thenceforth became the peerage of
Medina. Until the end of his life, Mohammed was
willing to forgive almost any sort of offence committed
by any one of them, for, as he wisely declared, he could
not be sure that Allah Himself had not given them free
leave to do as they chose.</p>

<p>At Mecca, however, very different scenes were witnessed.
The bitter pangs of shame and despair that
everyone felt upon learning of the stunning defeat soon
gave way to a fiery thirst for vengeance. For a month
this frenzy reigned; then human nature intervened and
a universal lament for the dead ascended, for almost
every home in Mecca had been bereaved. A harrowing
yet beautiful story illustrates how the grim self-restraint
of the Koreish was finally broken. One night an aged
father, who had lost two sons, heard the sound of weeping
and thus commanded his servant: “Go see! It
may be that Koreish have begun to wail for their dead;
perchance I too may wail, for grief consumeth me
within.” Informed that it was only a woman who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[p. 134]</span>
mourning for her strayed camel, he poured forth an
impassioned threnody. “Doth she weep for her camel,
and for it banish sleep from her eyes? Nay, if we will
weep, let us weep over Bedr&mdash;weep for Okeil, and for
Al-Harith the lion of lions!” Perhaps the Koreish now
realized the irreparable and fatal error they had made
in deciding to take Mohammed seriously. Had they
persisted in their original intention&mdash;mocked at him as
an idle dreamer and a crack-brained idiot&mdash;he might
have lived and died harmlessly in Mecca. But persecution
had proved to be his best friend: forced to defend
himself and to become the head of a little protecting
army, he had revealed an unsuspected military acumen
that had reduced his hostile kinsmen to this desperate
condition. One Spartan couple in Mecca, however,
refused to join in the common woe. “Weep not for
your slain, mourn not their loss, neither let the bard
bewail their fate,” was the stern advice of Abu Sufyan.
“If ye lament with elegies, it will ease your wrath and
diminish your enmity toward Mohammed and his fellows.
And, should that reach their ears, and they laugh
at us, will not their scorn be worse than all? Haply
the turn may come, and ye may yet obtain your revenge.
As for me, I will touch no oil, neither approach
my wife, until I shall have gone forth again to fight
with Mohammed.” And when Abu’s wife, Hind, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[p. 135]</span>
chided for refusing to wail for her father, brother and
uncle, she fiercely responded: “Nay, I will not weep
until ye again wage war with Mohammed and his fellows.
If tears could wipe the grief from off my heart,
I too would weep as ye; but it is not thus with Hind.”
Not to be outdone by her husband, she too declared
that she would neither use oil nor approach her marital
couch until an avenging Meccan army was on the march.</p>


<h3 title="Section 3">III</h3>

<p>Elated at his astounding success, the Prophet occupied
the following year in consolidating his gains and
extending his influence. Meanwhile he continued to
pay an exorbitant amount of homage to Allah, the
Giver of all good; but, in starting a universal espionage
system in Medina and in assuming an ever more menacing
attitude toward unbelievers and Jews, he appears
to have acted solely on his own responsibility. Nor
were the Koreish idle during this year. As time slowly
mitigated their poignant suffering, their business instincts
revived and new trade routes were mapped out;
the profits that accrued therefrom were stored up
against the eagerly awaited day when a fearful retribution
should be inflicted upon their murderous kinsmen.
Abu Sufyan, who was chafing under the irksome restrictions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[p. 136]</span>
of his vow, actually succeeded in destroying
some enemy property and in slaying two Moslems; but
when he joyfully hastened back to Mecca, under the
impression that he had earned the dissolution of his
oath, he discovered much to his chagrin that Hind did
not agree with him. The Moslems, irritated because
the Koreish had gained even such a slight success, retaliated
by capturing a caravan that yielded one hundred
thousand pieces of silver; yet, when the news of this
added indignity reached the Meccans, it only steeled
their already inflexible determination&mdash;the moment for
a swift and terrible vengeance had come.</p>

<p>Plans for a crushing campaign against the Moslems
were drawn up; and all the Koreishites strained every
nerve to expedite the martial plans and keep them
secret&mdash;all of them, that is, except Al-Abbas, who, for
some inexplicable reason, still retained a sneaking affection
for the hard-hearted nephew who had forced him
to pay such a stiff ransom. So it happened that, while
Mohammed was communing with Allah in the Mosque
during January, 625, a sealed letter, conveying the
dreadful news that three thousand Koreish, including
seven hundred warriors in armor and two hundred cavalry,
were ready to march upon Medina, was handed
to him. Despite the strongest efforts of the Prophet
to keep this information secret, it leaked out and caused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[p. 137]</span>
tremendous excitement and confusion. On this occasion,
Mohammed’s perpetually-recurring dreams portended
a defeat&mdash;he imagined that his sword was broken.
A public meeting was called to discuss the ominous
situation; and, according to some authorities, the Prophet
related his dream, which he interpreted thus:
“The fracture in my sword portendeth an injury to myself,”
adding that it would be wisest to remain within the
fortified walls of Medina. The elder Moslems agreed
with their leader, but the young Hotspurs arose in
violent opposition: they asserted that they would not
“sit quietly here, a laughing-stock to all Arabia,” but
would “go forth and smite our foes, even as we did at
Bedr.” The headstrong impetuosity of youth prevailed,
and Mohammed at length acceded. After
preaching a strong discourse, in which he assured them,
“If ye be steadfast, the Lord will grant you victory,”
he retired to his house, whence he shortly emerged
dressed in helmet and mail, with a sword hanging from
his girdle. This sight deeply distressed the Moslems,
for it appeared that their commander was at last going
to risk his life on the battlefield; they therefore begged
that he would follow his first counsel and remain within
Medina’s walls. But he sternly replied: “I invited
you to this and ye would not. It becometh not a
prophet, when once he hath girded himself to the battle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[p. 138]</span>
to lay his armor down again until the Lord hath decided
betwixt him and his enemies. Wait, therefore, on the
Lord. Only be steadfast, and He will send you
victory.”</p>

<p>The talismanic effect of these words was immediate,
and the Moslem army at once took to the field. It is
not clear whether Abdallah ibn Obei, at the head of
three hundred unbelievers, actually joined this army
and then deserted when it was on the march; for some
think that he never joined it at all. Mohammed is
represented as having forbidden the unbelievers to assist
him, saying that he did not desire “the aid of Unbelievers
to fight against the unbelieving”; though other
accounts maintain that Abdallah and his followers sallied
forth with the faithful, but deserted at first sight of
the enemy. Again, it is possible that Abdallah never
manifested any desire to fight at all&mdash;that the tales both
of his reprimand and desertion were invented by the
Moslems in order to emphasize the smallness of their
force. It was small enough, at all events, for barely
seven hundred Moslems went forth to face a foe more
than four times their own number. The Koreish had
meanwhile circled the city, until they drew up for battle
near the hill of Uhud, three miles to the north; and there
the army of Allah met them.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that, had the plan devised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[p. 139]</span>
by Mohammed been followed, a victory, or at least a
draw, would have been his. Realizing that success
against such overwhelming odds could be gained only by
far superior tactics and stratagems, he issued three imperative
commands. He instructed fifty sharpshooters
to remain, at all costs, on a little hill nearby, and prevent
any effort of the Koreishite cavalry to attack from
the rear&mdash;“stir not from this spot; if ye see us pursuing
and plundering the enemy, join not with us; if we be
pursued and even worsted, do not venture to our aid”&mdash;he
enjoined upon his prayer-trained troops the imperious
necessity of keeping their serried lines intact;
and he forbade them to advance until he gave the order,
for he rightly believed that, so long as his force cohered,
it would be impregnable. But the Prophet was destined
to learn that, once a body of men has tasted the
sweets of pillage and rapine, it is very likely not only
to forget its religious professions but to disobey its own
commander. When these admirable arrangements had
been made, he cautiously donned a second coat of armor
and sedately awaited for the foe to make the first move.</p>

<p>It was not long in coming. All at once the whole
Koreishite force began to advance, while a group of
women, headed by the bloodthirsty Hind and beating
timbrels and drums, preceded the men and accompanied
their rude music with stirring songs that promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[p. 140]</span>
special favors for the brave and threatened unbearable
calamities for the timid.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Daughters of the brave are we,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">On carpets step we delicately;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Boldly advance, and we embrace you!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Turn your backs and we will shun you&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Shun you with disdain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Then the Meccan champions, ardently desiring to win
favor in the eyes of their martial females, rushed forth
and dared individual Moslems to engage them in the
customary single combat&mdash;an invitation that was right
gladly accepted. And now the history of Bedr was
temporarily repeated, for a succession of Koreishites
fell before the superior efficiency of Allah’s favorites.
At first dismayed, and then angered, by the swift fate of
their leading standard-bearers, the Meccan force hurled
itself at the Moslem array; but its inflexible front withstood
the desperate assault, while the unerring archers,
stationed on the little hill, prevented the Koreishite
cavalry from disrupting the Moslem left wing. The
Meccans wavered, cracked apart, turned irresolutely,
and fled in ignominious haste, while the jubilant
Medinese, headed by their two heroes, Ali and Hamza,
bounded hotly after the pusillanimous fugitives.</p>

<p>But, just at this moment, the validity of Gabriel’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[p. 141]</span>
warning after Bedr became manifest. Certain of their
success, the Moslem ranks broke up and began to despoil
the enemy camp; and this gratifying spectacle, which
was seen by the archers, was too compelling to be resisted.
Uttering anticipatory shouts of glee, they deserted
their post and came running to join in the general
fun. And then the situation speedily changed.
No longer held at bay by a withering discharge of arrows,
the Meccan cavalry whirled suddenly around and
came smashing through the Moslem rear. Among
others the great Hamza fell, mortally wounded by a
javelin from the hand of a hired assassin. Hind, whose
father had been slain by Hamza at Bedr, had bribed her
Ethiopian slave, Wahshi, with the promise of freedom
should he lay Hamza low; and his body had hardly
ceased to quiver before Hind pounced savagely upon it,
ripped out his liver, which she tore to pieces with her
teeth, and collected his nails and fragments of skin to
make bracelets for her arms and legs. The Medinese,
taken completely by surprise and terror-stricken at the
death of their greatest warrior, incontinently abandoned
their arms and stolen property and began to run even
faster than the Koreish had done a few moments earlier.</p>

<p>When Mohammed observed this calamitous reversal,
he tried to rally his fleeing forces by expostulation.
“Whither away?” he shouted; “Come back! I am the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[p. 142]</span>
Apostle of God! Return!” But the Moslems were
much more interested just then in saving their skins than
in any number of prophets or gods; so Mohammed, for
the first time in his career, was forced to fight for his
life. We learn that he discharged arrows until his bow
broke, whereupon he madly hurled stones about, and
may possibly have killed one Meccan; yet, even in his
dire extremity, he did not forget to make vehement
promises of an incomparable reward in Paradise to any
Moslem who would keep the foe off his own person.
But his under lip was wounded, one of his front teeth
was broken, and a furious stroke drove his helmet-rings
into his cheek. Then, either because he was really
stunned or exceptionally clever, he fell to the ground
apparently dead, while among the Koreish the glad
cry “Mohammed is slain!” resounded far and wide.
Complete confusion seized the Moslems when they
heard this appalling shout, and in their consternation
they shrieked aloud, “Where now is the promise of his
Lord?” Yet this very circumstance probably saved
them from an utter rout, for the Koreish, certain of the
Prophet’s decease, believed that their main object was
attained and accordingly failed to take advantage of the
victory that lay so easily within their grasp.</p>

<p>For Mohammed, in fact, was still very much alive.
When this unbelievably good news spread, his confederates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[p. 143]</span>
could not refrain from shouting it aloud; but,
aware that he was yet in great danger, the Prophet
peremptorily checked them. He was borne to a cave
near by, where an attempt was made to care for his
wounds; the helmet-rings had penetrated so deeply into
his face that one poor fellow broke two teeth in a praiseworthy
attempt to pull them out. Mohammed’s courage
had now come back to such an extent that he essayed
to apostrophize his enemies thus: “How shall a people
prosper that treat thus their Prophet who calleth them
unto the Lord! Let the wrath of God burn against
the men that have besprinkled the face of His Apostle
with his own blood! Let not the year pass over them
alive!” At the same time, however, he deemed it advisable
to change armor with another Moslem, in case
the Koreish might come to search for him; then, rejoining
his followers outside the cave, he glared at the Meccans
retreating in the distance.</p>

<p>Just at this moment Abu Sufyan, who, puffed with
pride, had remained to taunt his discomfited foes, called
out, “Mohammed! Abu Bekr! Omar!” and, hearing
no response, shouted, “Then all are slain, and ye are rid
of them!” This was too much for Omar to endure with
equanimity; and so, disobeying the Prophet, he bellowed:
“Thou liest! They are all alive, thou enemy
of God, and will requite thee yet.” Hearing this, Abu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[p. 144]</span>
Sufyan twitted Omar with these words: “Then this
day shall be a return for Bedr. Fortune alternates as
the bucket. Hearken! ye will find mutilated ones upon
the field; this was not my desire, but neither am I displeased
thereat. Glory to Al-Ozza! Glory to Hubal!
Al-Ozza is ours, not yours!” It was now Mohammed’s
turn to be vexed, though he wisely entrusted his retort
to Omar who, properly primed by his chief, exclaimed:
“The Lord is ours; He is not yours!” Abu Sufyan, who
thought that the argument was becoming rather childish,
merely answered, “We shall meet after a year at
Bedr.” “Be it so!” growled Omar; and then Abu, together
with Hind his spouse, made haste to return home
so that they might mutually dissolve their twelve-months’
oath.</p>

<p>Only twenty Koreish had been slain, whereas the
stark bodies of seventy-four Moslems were stiffening on
the battlefield. Thither Mohammed now betook himself,
and, upon seeing Hamza’s defiled corpse, he tugged
angrily at his beard and swore that he would treat
thirty Koreishite bodies in a similar way; but later he
repented of this remark, and indeed issued stern orders
forbidding his troops ever to mutilate a fallen enemy.
The crumpled Moslem army then set out for Medina,
for it was feared that the Koreish might decide to attack
the defenseless city; but a scout soon came hastening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[p. 145]</span>
up, shouting aloud the cheering news that the Koreish
were hurrying southward toward Mecca. “Gently,”
Mohammed mildly chided him, “let us not appear before
the people to rejoice at the departure of the
enemy!” For the Prophet was already profoundly absorbed
in meditating schemes that would enable him
satisfactorily to explain his defeat. But just now the
sense of loss excluded every other emotion from the
minds of the refugees and allies&mdash;the explanations could
wait. Mingled with the ubiquitous sorrow was a feeling
of helpless insecurity: the Koreish might yet change
their minds and retrace their steps; so a watch was stationed
at the Prophet’s door, behind which he went to
sleep so soundly that he failed to obey Bilal’s indefatigable
call to evening prayers. The Meccans, however,
who at this time had another easy opportunity to alter
the map of the world, had decided that they had evened
matters up with their kinsmen&mdash;and besides, they were
much more interested in starting their remunerative
caravans on the march again than in making or unmaking
history.</p>

<p>Faced for the first time by an apparently irretrievable
disaster, Mohammed well realized that not merely
were his assumptions of sacerdotal preëminence, Allah
Himself, and indeed all Islam, in imminent danger, but
that his very existence would be at stake unless he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[p. 146]</span>
proved able to satisfy the querulous clamors of his
people and explain just how it was that he had failed.
Never did his greatness reveal itself more splendidly
than in this emergency; his every action was planned
with the utmost care. His public demonstration of
grief for Hamza, and his decision to visit the field of
Uhud once a year to bless its Moslem martyrs&mdash;where,
on each occasion, he regularly repeated the safe formula,
“Peace be on you for that which ye endured, and a
blessed futurity above!”&mdash;may have been genuine
enough; at all events, such actions would be calculated
to impress his underlings with his sincerity. But
mutinous murmurs were now rampant: if Allah’s arm
had brought victory at Bedr, what was He doing on the
day of Uhud? and in any case what was to be thought of
the Prophet’s multitudinous promises? Yet these apparently
unanswerable complaints were no match for
Mohammed’s wily brain. The masterful orator kept
silence until the time came when, as was customary on
Friday, he made known the latest dispatches from
Allah in the Mosque.</p>

<p>And there he held the complainers in the hollow of his
hand. The time and the place itself, with its rude but
impressive grandeur, its venerable associations, its
atmosphere of religious awe, had been chosen with surpassing
care; and, before a word had been uttered, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[p. 147]</span>
audience was unconsciously in a passive, hypnotic state.
Then the Prophet, loosing every ounce of his tremendous
nervous energy, poured forth a harangue in which
subtle explanations, reproof, denunciation, self-justification,
and finally mild praise and encouragement were
blended with superb artistry. If Allah had conferred
victory at Bedr, through the instrumentality of “the
havoc-making angels,” He had permitted a defeat at
Uhud in order to separate the true believers from the
hypocrites; then, too, Allah <em>had</em> been with them until
they disobeyed the Prophet&mdash;“When you ran off precipitately,
and did not wait for any one, and the Apostle
was calling you from your rear.” The cowardice of
those who had stayed at home, as well as lust for loot,
had also played a large part in the defeat; but the
Prophet himself was blameless, for he had accepted the
decision of a majority of Moslems as to where and how
the battle should be fought. Nor had the Koreish
gained by winning: “We grant them respite only that
they may add to their sins; and they shall have a disgraceful
chastisement.” Furthermore, was it possible
that the Moslems had forgotten that the dead were
infinitely better off in Paradise?&mdash;where “No terror
afflicteth them, neither are they grieved.” And even if
Mohammed, being only mortal like other men and
“other Apostles that have gone before him,” had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[p. 148]</span>
killed, Islam must still continue: “What! if he were
to die or be killed, must ye needs turn back upon your
heels?” And finally: “Be not cast down, neither be
ye grieved. Ye shall yet be victorious if ye are true
Believers.”</p>

<p>When it was over, every shamefaced person present
was thoroughly convinced that the Prophet, alone
among the Moslems, was wholly guiltless, that Allah
was more adorable than ever, and that the defeat at
Uhud was an excellent example of a remarkably successful
strategic retreat.</p>

</div>

<h3 title="Section 1">I</h3>

<p class="firstpara">Another year sped by, until the appointed time came
for the Koreish and the Moslems to clash again at Bedr.
A prolonged drought, however, had impaired the Meccan
finances to such an extent that Abu Sufyan decided
it would be advisable to postpone the engagement;
so, summoning strategy to his aid, he caused a rumor to
be diffused through Medina to the effect that the Koreish
had equipped a vast army for the impending conflict.
The Moslems, whose spirits had not yet recovered
from the shock of Uhud, were so perturbed at this report
that they were unwilling to venture forth; but Mohammed,
whose espionage system had now penetrated
even as far as the confines of Mecca and who, therefore,
was probably aware of Abu Sufyan’s ruse, swore a
great oath that he would march to Bedr even though
he marched alone. Shamed by their leader’s heroism,
the Medinese recovered their courage; and the Prophet,
at the head of fifteen hundred men, set out for Bedr
in the spring of 626. The Koreish also finally scraped
up enough tepid enthusiasm to venture forth with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[p. 150]</span>
army of over two thousand men; but they soon turned
back, so they later declared, because of the lack of provisions.
Though the Moslems were by no means sorry
to hear of this, they publicly boasted their contempt
for the “water-gruel” force from Mecca; then, since it
was the time of the annual fairs, they remained eight
days at Bedr profiting greatly from the sale of the
abundant wares they had carried in their train.</p>

<p>If, as it now appeared to Mohammed, the Koreish
were disposed to keep the peace, the extended lull in
hostilities would furnish an admirable opportunity to
flaunt the banners of Islam over an ever widening extent
of Arabia; for the defeat of Uhud, no less than
the success at Bedr, had profoundly convinced him that
the ultimate victory of Islam depended upon the sword.
The Koran of this period breathes defiance against the
enemies of Islam on almost every page; its profuse
maledictions, once confined to the evildoers of Mecca,
now include all unbelievers everywhere. All other
things, even the hitherto unescapable performance of
daily prayers, take second place to the relentless promulgation
of the faith by military means. “When ye
march abroad in the earth, it shall be no crime unto you
that ye shorten your prayers, if ye fear that the Unbelievers
may attack you.” Such an inducement was
remarkably well calculated to win over to the army those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[p. 151]</span>
numerous believers who had discovered that five highly
complicated daily contortions were a little irksome, and
the Moslem force therefore grew by leaps and bounds.
As a result, during the summer of 626 Mohammed was
able to conduct a successful campaign as far north as
the border of Syria&mdash;an event of incalculable import.
For the first time the tentacles of Islam had stretched
beyond the bounds of Arabia: the curtain had risen on
the first scene of a world-wide drama that still awaits
its last act.</p>

<p>It seems probable that these sweeping expeditions at
length aroused the Arabians to the danger that threatened
them all. At all events, in the early months of
627 it happened that a confederacy of Koreishite,
Bedouin and Jewish tribes put an army numbering approximately
ten thousand men in the field against
Medina. The Prophet well knew that the memories of
Uhud, still rankling in the minds of his compatriots,
made it highly inexpedient to desert the city and meet
the oncoming foe in the open field. Yet Medina must
be defended at all costs&mdash;everyone, even the most feeble-kneed,
was agreed upon that&mdash;and feverish counsels
were held to devise a plan whereby the city might be
made impregnable against assault. At this crucial
juncture, a Persian ex-slave suggested that the city be
entrenched in the same way as, in his travels, he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[p. 152]</span>
observed that the Mesopotamian cities were protected.
Acting immediately upon his inspired advice, the Moslems
filled in the gaps between their outer line of stone
houses with a stone wall; and, at the southeastern quarter,
which was entirely defenseless, a deep and wide ditch
was dug. After six days of prodigious and incessant
labor, the trench was completed. The Prophet threw
himself heartily into the work, and, dirty and weary as
he was, joined his stentorian voice in unison with the
other toilers as they once again intoned the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“O Lord! there is no happiness but that of Futurity.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">O Lord! have mercy on the Citizens and the Refugees!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The result was that, when Abu Sufyan came marching
up at the head of his conglomerate force, all that he
could do was to permit his troops to shoot some harmless
showers of arrows, pitch his tents, sit down, and
wait for the Moslems to come forth. Entrenchments
as a military device were entirely unknown in Arabia;
so the invaders logically concluded that Mohammed was
not a good sport&mdash;as on other occasions, he had violated
the Arabic code of chivalry by proving that he had
brains. “Truly this ditch is the artifice of strangers,”
they yelled, “a shift to which no Arab yet has ever
stooped!” But the Moslems did not take the hint, and
so next day the besiegers made a gallantly unsuccessful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[p. 153]</span>
attempt to rush the barricade by sheer weight of numbers.
Nevertheless, the assault accomplished one very
irritating thing: for a whole day the devoutest of the
Moslems had been prevented from saying their prayers.
Gratifying amends for this forced neglect of Allah,
however, were made when night fell; at that time an
individual service was held for each omitted supplication,
and Mohammed contributed a special comminatory
request: “They have kept us from our daily prayers;
God fill their bellies and their graves with fire!” Indeed,
while the siege lasted, the Prophet spent most of
the hours in protracted prayer, though he managed to
find time enough to guard himself against the threatening
activities of the Jews and other disaffected Medinese.
Nor did his devices stop here. He even tried
to buy off the Bedouins by promising them a third of
the fruit from Medina’s date-trees; but his leading allies,
the Aus and the Khazraj, opposed his trickiness and
admonished him to “give nothing unto them but the
sword.” Mohammed then played his trump card: if
war was but a game of deception, why should he not
skillfully divide the enemy against themselves? He instructed
a trusty go-between to spread dissension among
the foe by persuading the Bedouins and Jews in turn
that their interests were mutually opposed. The
scheme worked without a hitch, for the attacking forces,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[p. 154]</span>
already discouraged by the cold, the difficulty of obtaining
food, and the protracted delay, were ready to leave
on any excuse. As a result, when a chilling storm of
wind and rain incommoded them on the fifteenth day,
they folded their tents and silently stole away. “Break
up the camp and march,” commanded Abu Sufyan.
“As for myself I am gone”&mdash;and he suited his action to
his words by clambering hastily upon his camel and trying
to urge it away while its fore leg was still hitched.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the last camel disappeared when the
Prophet, after thanking Allah for his timely assistance
in sending the storm, was visited by Gabriel. “What!”
chided the tireless angel, “hast thou laid aside thine
armor, while as yet the angels have not laid theirs aside!
Arise! go up against the Beni Koreiza.” This Jewish
tribe, which inhabited a fortress several miles southeast
of Medina, had been the last to succumb to the blandishments
of Abu Sufyan, but had finally yielded and taken
part in the assault on Medina; so Mohammed made
haste to obey the celestial behest, even though he had
previously borrowed from the Beni Koreiza the picks
and shovels with which the trench had been excavated.
Heading three thousand soldiers, he immediately
marched to the Jewish stronghold where, inasmuch as it
was marvelously protected by nature rather than its inhabitants,
he found it necessary to keep guard for several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[p. 155]</span>
weeks. In the end the Jews agreed to surrender
on condition that the Aus, their supposed allies, should
decide their fate. To this Mohammed agreed, and the
Aus, almost with one voice, demanded that the Beni
Koreiza should be treated gently; yet they signified
their willingness to abide by the decision of their chief,
a huge, corpulent fellow named Sa’d.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that Sa’d, suffering from an arrow-wound
inflicted during the late siege, was not in a
pleasant frame of mind; and it has been surmised that
Mohammed may have craftily reckoned on this very
fact. “Proceed with thy judgment!” he commanded
Sa’d. “Will ye, then,” inquired Sa’d of his tribesmen,
“bind yourselves by the covenant of God that whatsoever
I shall decide, ye will accept?” After they had
murmured their assent, he spoke. “My judgment is
that the men shall be put to death, the women and children
sold into slavery, and the spoil divided amongst
the army.” A torrent of objections was about to be
poured forth, when the Prophet savagely commanded
silence. “Truly the judgment of Sa’d is the judgment
of God,” he declared, “pronounced on high from beyond
the Seventh Heaven.” Trenches were dug that
night, and next morning some seven or eight hundred
men were marched out, forced to seat themselves in
rows along the top of the trenches, were forthwith beheaded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[p. 156]</span>
and then tumbled into the long, gaping grave;
the Prophet meanwhile looked on until, tiring of the
monotonous spectacle, he departed to amuse himself
with a Jewess whose husband had just perished. But
poor Sa’d did not live long to enjoy his revenge; barely
had he reached home when his wounds re-opened and
he soon breathed his last. As he lay dying, the Prophet
held him in his arms and prayed thus: “O Lord!
Verily Sa’d hath labored in thy service. He hath believed
in thy Prophet, and hath fulfilled his covenant.
Wherefore do thou, O Lord, receive his spirit with the
best reception wherewith thou receivest a departing
soul!” Mohammed also helped to carry the coffin
which, the bearers noted, was remarkably light for so
heavy a man; but the Prophet explained the matter to
the satisfaction of all. “The angels are carrying the
bier, therefore it is light in your hands. Verily the
throne on high doth vibrate for Sa’d, and the portals of
heaven are opened, and he is attended by seventy thousand
angels that never trod the earth before.”</p>


<h3 title="Section 2">II</h3>

<p>Busily occupied though he had been for several years
with the gradual subjugation of the Koreish, Mohammed
had yet found time to compel a motley group of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[p. 157]</span>
less important enemies to bow meekly beneath the yoke
of Islam. The extinction of the Beni Koreiza had been
but one link in the long chain of his conquests. His
Meccan kinsmen had naturally been the first to be imperiously
brushed aside; but other temporary impediments
had occasionally blocked his way.</p>

<p>Among them the few Christians who were scattered
here and there throughout Arabia were of least moment.
Split asunder as they were into various warring
sects&mdash;the Monothelites, Jacobites, Melchites and Nestorians&mdash;they
worried the Prophet but little; he seems
to have regarded them with a tolerant and mildly
amused eye. Having had scanty intercourse with them,
he was probably quite ignorant of their disputatious
creeds; therefore, while the Koran always speaks respectfully
of the Saviour, Who is invariably designated
“Jesus, Son of Mary,” it makes many deplorable errors
when it discusses the tenets and theogony of Christianity.
It expressly denies that Jesus is the Son of God
and completely repudiates the established doctrine of
the Holy Trinity: “Wherefore believe in God, and
in the Apostles; and say not, <em>There are Three</em>. Refrain:
it will be better for you. Verily the Lord is one
God. Glory be to Him! far be it from Him, that there
should be to Him a Son.” And Mohammed seems to
have made the even more egregious error of supposing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[p. 158]</span>
that the Trinity which he condemned was composed of
the Father, Jesus and Mary; for the Koran utterly
fails to recognize the incontrovertible existence of the
Holy Ghost. Thus, while it has been reasonably urged
that the Prophet both comprehended and hated Roman
Catholicism, it may just as plausibly be argued that the
conception of the Holy Spirit as a separate and distinct
entity was too subtle for his eminently practical mind
to grasp.</p>

<p>With Judaism, however, the case was very different.
Though the Koran might place Christ on par with
Abraham, Moses, David and other Hebrew prophets,
it was to the customs and rites of the Jews that Mohammed
paid obeisance rather than to those that had
clustered around Christianity. Scarcely had he taken
up his residence in Medina when he deliberately humbled
himself in an effort to placate and win over the
Jews; for, knowing their numbers and their power, he
strongly desired to enter into a lasting union with
them. To that end, he bound himself and his adherents
to the Jews in a contract whose obligations were relatively
mutual: “The Jews will profess their religion,
the Moslems theirs.... No one shall go forth to war
excepting with the permission of Mohammed; but this
shall not hinder any from seeking lawful revenge....
If attacked, each shall come to the assistance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[p. 159]</span>
other.... War and Peace shall be made in common.”
There is also every reason to suppose that the command
promulgated by Allah, when the Prophet visited Him in
the Seventh Heaven, to the effect that all loyal Moslems
must henceforth direct their prayers five times daily
toward Jerusalem, was given because Mohammed expected
that the Jews, seeing the Moslems thus busily
engaged, would be insidiously flattered and insensibly
led to look favorably upon Islam. Nor did his efforts
stop here. The period of fasting which he had decreed
for the Moslems coincided with that time during which
the Hebrews also abstained from food; when Jewish
funeral processions passed, the Prophet and his brethren
honored them by standing until they had disappeared;
and the rite of circumcision&mdash;commonly practised
by all Arabs out of deference to Abraham, the
supposed founder of their holy city, Mecca&mdash;was also
submitted to by the Moslems to the further pleasure of
the Jews, who, however, remained in mystified ignorance
as to whether Mohammed himself had undergone that
ceremony. It is furthermore likely that the Hebraic
horror of Christianity made the Jews look favorably
upon this newcomer who, while he might not correspond
exactly with the prophet who had been so long and so
unsuccessfully anticipated by them, at least appeared
to approximate their ideal. What else could be thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span>
of a man who formulated the amazing doctrine that a
Jew might synchronously be a devout follower of Abraham
and Allah, and might therefore attend both the
services of the Mosque and the Synagogue with equal
impunity? Indeed, there is much evidence to support
the view that, had the Jews saluted Mohammed as <em>the</em>
prophet who had at last arrived among them, Islam
would have been rapidly absorbed by Hebraism.</p>

<p>But Allah had other plans. A year’s commingled
residence in Medina taught the members of both sects
many, many things. Inasmuch as the Jews literally
owned the city, the needy Moslems were compelled to
turn to them for positions, provisions and for money to
borrow; and they soon learnt that their creditors were
as merciless as they were devout. Abu Bekr, having
approached a certain Pinchas with the quaint request,
“Who will lend God a good loan?” was rebuffed with
the quick retort, “If God wants a loan, He must be in
distressed circumstances”; whereupon Abu, who had
absolutely no flair for repartee, won some slight consolation
by knocking Pinchas down. The Prophet
himself&mdash;who, even after he began to extirpate the Hebrews,
invariably turned to them when his financial
credit was bad&mdash;had experiences similar to Abu’s; and
it is a matter of interest that he now for the first time
began to notice that the odors arising from the Jewish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[p. 161]</span>
habitations were decidedly offensive to his ever-fastidious
nose. Another thing that fanned the rising
fires of disaffection was the fact that, for more than a
year after the Hegira, no Moslem woman gave birth
to a child; and the Jews openly bragged that their secret
sorceries and enchantments had produced this barrenness.
The Moslems, completely upset over this unheard-of
catastrophe, exhausted themselves in the attempt
to discover an adequate remedy; and the Prophet
was so much concerned that he probably composed two
Suras especially designed to frustrate the Jewish spells.
Yet, in spite of the Hebraic incantations, a Moslem
child was born fourteen months after the flight to
Medina, and never again was there any doubt as to
the fertility of the Moslem women.</p>

<p>The Jews, too, had experienced a mental revolution.
A prophet who, as they had discovered, could not speak
Hebrew, and who, when put to the test, betrayed an
abysmal ignorance concerning the wealth of intricate
information stored in the Pentateuch, did not wholly
correspond to their idealized conception of their Messiah.
They might blandly admit that his dissertations
were satisfactory, but when he pressed his prophetic
claims upon them they courteously retorted that <em>their</em>
particular prophet must be able to trace his lineage
straight back to David. They objected, also, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[p. 162]</span>
they noted how great a proportion of his time Mohammed
spent in his harem, whereas the Jews, of all people,
might well have regarded that harmless idiosyncrasy as
a clinching proof that his mission was divine. Again,
when the Prophet vainly tried to save the life of one of
his earliest converts by cauterizing his sore throat, the
Jews poked fun at him. “If this man were a prophet,
could he not have warded off sickness from his friend?”
they mockingly asked. And all that Mohammed could
think of to say was this: “I have no power from my
Lord over even mine own life, or over that of any of my
followers. The Lord destroy the Jews that speak
thus!” From this time on, instead of sitting up night
after night, as he had once done, telling affecting tales
about the Children of Israel, he began to belabor their
descendants in the pages of the Koran. Where it had
once iterated and reiterated the manifold virtues of the
ancient Hebrews, it now discussed their manifold vices&mdash;their
idolatries, backslidings, and betrayals&mdash;at even
greater length; and an almost Christian fervor breathes
from those pages where the Prophet asseverates that the
wilful stupidity of the Jews caused them to reject him
even as they had previously spurned Jesus.</p>

<p>Some faint-hearted Hebrews, who perhaps suspected
what was coming, were diplomatic enough to swallow
the new faith entire, thereby winning from Mohammed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[p. 163]</span>
the appellation of “Witnesses.” Abdallah, son of
Salam, was a shining example. Having slyly induced
his brethren to give him a character testimonial before
they knew that he was about to become a renegade, he
presented it to the Prophet who was so pleased that he
assured Abdallah he was already in Paradise&mdash;even
Sa’d, chief of the Aus, had not received a comparable
congratulation. But Abdallahs among the Jews were
rare. Most of them continued to snicker at the hilarious
ignorance and bombast revealed in Mohammed’s
homiletical discourses, to disregard Allah’s grim warning
that they should repent and turn to Islam “before
We deface your countenances, turning the face backwards,”
and to wax fat on the miseries of the Moslems.
On the other hand, the Moslems themselves no longer
made any effort to conceal their desire to hold their
noses when they were compelled to approach the Jews
on business matters; and the Prophet himself shortly
decided to put a summary end to all attempts at
reconciliation and brotherhood.</p>

<p>Perhaps the success that attended his decision to
fight during the sacred months suggested the idea that
he was now strong enough to break definitely with the
Jews. One day, not long afterward, while he stood at
prayer in the Mosque with his face turned as usual
toward the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, he received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[p. 164]</span>
a lightning revelation to turn “toward the holy
Temple of Mecca. Wheresoever ye be, when ye pray,
turn toward the same.” The divine injunction came
just after he had prostrated himself twice toward
Jerusalem; quick as a flash he reversed himself&mdash;an action
instinctively followed by all the automatons in the
audience&mdash;and faced toward the south until the service
was ended. This symbolic event signalized his determination
henceforth to separate himself wholly from
the Jews, as well as to gratify the atavistic longings of
his zealots who had never quite succeeded in relinquishing
their love for the Black Stone and the Kaba; then
too, Mohammed had grown very tired of listening to a
favorite Hebraic taunt: “This Prophet of yours knew
not where to find his Kibla [house of worship] till we
pointed it out to him.” The Jews, who fully understood
the sinister significance of Mohammed’s sudden
right-about-face, were much perturbed; and they had
reason to be, for he lost no time in sundering every tie
that connected the worship of Allah with Hebraic
ceremonies. He commanded the Moslems to keep their
fast before or after the Jewish Day of Atonement; he
once more followed the Arabic custom of combing his
hair instead of letting it drift loose, as the Jews did;
he altered the Moslem funeral rites so that they again
corresponded to the immemorial Pagan ritual; and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[p. 165]</span>
changed the regulations pertaining to the lunar indisposition
of females to a system that <a id="p165"></a>Moses assuredly
would not have approved. For it must be demonstrated
that Allah was more powerful than Jehovah; that Mohammed,
as the last of a long line of prophets, had an
ultimate claim upon the sacerdotal office; and that the
superior wisdom which the Jews boasted concerning
celestial matters over which he had hitherto asserted his
sole jurisdiction would be of no use whatever to them&mdash;after
they were dead.</p>


<h3 title="Section 3">III</h3>

<p>The triumph of Bedr encouraged Mohammed to expedite
his plans of revenge against his internal foes;
directly or indirectly, he stimulated his accomplices to
assassinate them. Peculiarly sensitive as he was to the
slurring satires and puns which the Jews had aimed
against some of his most cherished speeches, and being
wholly incapable of retorting in kind, he was only
too pleased when the Moslems showed a demoniacal
readiness to avenge his wounded honor with sharper-pointed
weapons than epigrams. Asma, a poetess
strongly on the side of the Jews, composed some verses
that castigated the disaffected Medinese for bowing before
an interloper whom she represented as hoping that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[p. 166]</span>
the city would “be done brown” so that he might enjoy
a toothsome banquet; shortly afterward, one of the
Prophet’s men stole into her room at midnight and,
after taking the trouble to remove her nursing baby,
thrust his sword through her breast. Next morning
Mohammed paused in his prayers at the Mosque long
enough to inquire of the murderer, “Hast thou slain
the daughter of Merwan?” “Yes,” was the reply, “but
tell me now, is there cause of apprehension?” “None,”
the Prophet assured him, “a couple of goats will hardly
knock their heads together for it.” Then, turning toward
the congregation, he shouted: “If ye desire
to see a man that hath assisted the Lord and His Prophet,
look ye here!” A second satirist, old Abu Afak,
a Jewish convert, foolishly attempted to carry on the
work begun by Asma. “Who will rid me of this pestilent
fellow?” inquired Mohammed; and within a few
hours Abu Afak, while carelessly sleeping in a courtyard,
was also transfixed with a sword. Both of these
deeds were committed within a week after Bedr.</p>

<p>About six months later one Ka’b, another Jewish
versifier who, like most satirists of his time, signalized
his craft by anointing his hair on one side, allowing his
clothes to become disordered, and wearing but one shoe,
decided to amuse himself by making public a series of
poems that were intimately concerned with the amatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[p. 167]</span>
charms of some of the most generous Moslem
women. Of a beauty named Um al-Fadl he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hanging">“Of saffron color is she; so full of charms that if thou wert to
clasp her, there would be pressed forth Wine, Henna, and
Katam;</p>

<p class="hanging">So slim that her figure, from ankle to shoulder, bends as she
desires to stand upright, and cannot.</p>

<p class="hanging">When we met she caused me to forget my own wife Um Halim,
although the cord that bindeth me to her is not to be
broken.</p>

<p class="hanging">I never saw the sun appear by night, except on one dark evening
when she came forth unto me in all her splendor.”</p>
</div>

<p>Ka’b was also believed to be engaged in double dealings
with the Koreish, and so the Prophet offered this public
prayer: “O Lord, deliver me from the son of Al-Ashraf,
in whatever way it seemeth good unto Thee,
because of his open sedition and his verses.” And lest
there might be doubt as to how he wished his supplication
to be fulfilled, he asked his servants this pointed
question: “Who will ease me of the son of Al-Ashraf?
for he troubleth me.” Maslama’s son Mohammed, a
well-known Moslem libertine, responded, “Here am I&mdash;I
will slay him.” “Go!” exclaimed the happy
Prophet, “the blessing of God be with you, and assistance
from on High!” Aided by four conspirators,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[p. 168]</span>
this Mohammed succeeded in luring Ka’b away from
his bride on a moonlight night. Suddenly seizing his
long hair, they pulled him to the ground with the shout:
“Slay him! Slay the enemy of God!” and immediately
stabbed him to death. “Welcome!” said Mohammed
on their return, “for your countenances beam of victory.”
“And thine also, O Prophet!” they replied,
as the victim’s head was tossed down before his feet.</p>

<p>On the following day Mohammed, having decided
that the only good Jews were dead or exiled ones, gave
the Moslems free leave to kill them upon sight. Muheisa,
a converted Khazrajite, at once availed himself of
this long-desired privilege by slaughtering the first Hebrew
he chanced to meet; and when his brother Huweisa
chided him for his excessive zealotry, he growled:
“By the Lord! if he that commanded me to kill him had
commanded to kill thee also, I would have done it.”
“What!” screamed Huweisa, “wouldst thou have slain
thine own brother at Mohammed’s bidding?” “Even
so,” was the cool answer. “Strange indeed!” said the
aghast Huweisa, “hath the new religion reached to this?
Verily, it is a wonderful faith!” And he immediately
proclaimed his own conversion to Islam.</p>

<p>Many of the Jews would doubtless have liked to
follow his example, but their day of grace was past;
no longer could they qualify as “Witnesses” for Mohammed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[p. 169]</span>
For indeed his heart was set upon their extermination,
or&mdash;what was even better&mdash;the robbery of
their goods; and to that end, like a good general, he
proceeded first against those who dwelt in Medina.
About a month after Bedr, he went to the wealthy tribe
of Beni Kainuka, who practised the goldsmiths’ trade
in Medina, and peremptorily announced his errand
thus: “By the Lord! ye know full well that I am the
Apostle of God. Believe, therefore, before that happen
to you which has befallen Koreish!” But they
hurled defiance at him, so he decided to wait until he
could find a convenient excuse to attack them. He
soon found it. As a Moslem girl was trading in a
goldsmith’s shop one day, a frivolous-minded Jew
sought entertainment by creeping up behind her and
pinning the bottom of her skirt to her shoulder; howls
of merriment followed and the poor maiden almost died
of shame. A Moslem who soon avenged the insult by
slaying the sprightly Jew was killed in turn by other
Jews; and thus the Prophet was conscientiously able
to proceed against the Beni Kainuka&mdash;for had they not
broken the solemn treaty hitherto contracted between
the Moslems and the Hebrews? A fortnight’s siege
ended in their abject surrender; their hands were then
tied and they were led out to be executed. At this moment
Abdallah ibn Obei, who still retained some remnants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[p. 170]</span>
of power in Medina, approached the Prophet
with a plea for mercy. But the only reply was an
averted face, so Abdallah seized Mohammed’s arm and
repeated his request. “Let me go!” the Prophet angrily
screamed; then, since Abdallah still clung to him,
he again shouted, “Wretch, let me go!” But Abdallah
continued to hang on, begging that pity be shown;
and Mohammed, who still feared Abdallah’s might,
grudgingly commanded, “Let them go!” though he
could not refrain from adding, “The Lord curse them,
and him too!” So their lives were spared, but their
rich possessions were confiscated and they were at once
sent into banishment; and Mohammed solaced himself
for his Pyrrhic victory by selecting the choicest of their
weapons for himself. When Abdallah bitterly reproved
one of the Prophet’s leading confederates, he
was met by the curt response: “Hearts have changed.
Islam hath blotted all treaties out.”</p>

<p>Such, indeed, was the fact. Within a year the murderer
of Ka’b was dispatched to the Jewish tribe of Beni
an-Nadir&mdash;which was suspected of being in secret
league with the Koreish&mdash;with this commission: “Thus
saith the Prophet of the Lord. Ye shall go forth from
out of my land within the space of ten days; whosoever
after that remaineth behind shall be put to death.”
When they protested on the ground that such treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[p. 171]</span>
would be rather severe on a people who had never
injured Islam, Mohammed’s envoy merely remarked,
“Hearts are changed now,” and abruptly left them.
After prolonged and anxious consultation, they decided
to hold fast to their fortress&mdash;a proceeding so unusual
for their race that, when the Prophet heard of it, he
shouted in delight: “Allah Akbar! The Jews are going
to fight! Great is the Lord!” His enthusiasm
was somewhat dampened, however, when he discovered
that a lengthy siege failed to dislodge them; accordingly,
he determined to hasten matters by destroying
the pick of their palm-trees with fire and axe. They
protested that this act was both barbarous and contrary
to Mosaic law; and, while Mohammed was no
longer much interested in Moses, he well knew that
his deed was opposed to the unwritten laws of Arabian
warfare. The Koran, therefore, was soon adorned with
this exculpatory passage: “That which thou didst cut
down of the Date-trees, or left of them standing upon
their roots, it was by the command of God, that He
might abase the evil-doers.” The Beni an-Nadir, in
fact, were so completely abased by the relentless siege
that they were glad to surrender their lands and go into
exile on the generous condition that their lives should
be spared.</p>

<p>These episodes relating to the Beni Kainuka and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[p. 172]</span>
Beni an-Nadir are only two of many like illustrations,
that might be discussed at wearisome length, which
demonstrated two significant facts: Mohammed had
succeeded in ridding Medina of its indwelling foes,
and he had decided to destroy the Jewish settlements
throughout all Arabia. The massacre of the Beni
Koreiza followed as a matter of course; and in 628 the
last Hebraic stronghold of much account was also dismantled.
In the summer of that year Mohammed,
heading sixteen hundred men, pounced upon the opulent
city of Kheibar, which lay about one hundred miles
to the north of Medina&mdash;a distance that shows how wide
the sweep of the Prophet’s victorious arm had reached.
The motive which inspired him to assault this people
appears to have sprung from the consideration that
they had failed to avenge the murder of one of their
own tribesmen by a Moslem; for the Prophet may well
have believed that such an aggressively peace-loving
clan merited the severest punishment. In any case,
they were not true believers; and, at this stage of Islam,
that fact in itself constituted a more than ample pretext
for the opening of hostilities. Kheibar’s forts fell
in rapid succession before the impetuous rush of the
now veteran Moslem army. As Mohammed gaily
charged from one conquered stronghold to another, he
continually raised the rapturous shout: “Allah Akbar!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[p. 173]</span>
Great is the Lord! Truly when I light upon the
coasts of any People, woe unto them in that day!”
After the conquest was complete, Kinana, chieftain of
Kheibar, was tortured in the hope that he would reveal
his hidden treasure. Fires were burnt upon his breast
until he was so nearly dead that he could not have confessed
even had he so desired; and Mohammed, who
realized that he had carried the thing too far, ordered
his head to be chopped off.</p>

<p>Kinana’s notoriously beautiful wife, the seventeen-year-old
Safiya, and her companion were then fetched
up to the Prophet; the companion, seeing the headless
trunk, beat her face and howled aloud. “Take that
she-devil hence!” snapped Mohammed; but he tenderly
folded his mantle around Safiya’s head to screen
her from the sight, for he had determined to marry her.
His approaching nuptials, however, were nearly ruined
by Zeinab, a Jewess who had lost all her male relatives
and her husband on that fateful day. She poisoned a
kid, tastily garnished it, and then placed it before him,
smiling and coaxing him to eat. Having distributed
the least desirable parts among his fellows, he bit off
a choice mouthful from the shoulder; but barely had
his teeth closed on it when he cried, “Hold! surely this
shoulder hath been poisoned,” and indecorously spat it
out. One man who had partaken of the meat died, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[p. 174]</span>
Mohammed himself is reputed to have been afflicted
with such violent pains that he was repeatedly cupped
between the shoulders; yet within a short time he was
observed to disappear with the fickle-hearted and coyly
reluctant Safiya behind the bridal tent.</p>

<p>Thus the former Meccan merchant and exile passed
from conquest to conquest. He was now not only a
prophet&mdash;plenty of contemporary men professed a similarly
exclusive claim to that commonplace title&mdash;but
the recognized dictator over Medina and an extensive
range of contingent territory; furthermore, the terror
inspired by the mere mention of his name had penetrated
to the most distant stretches of Arabia, and was
beginning to arouse sinister forebodings in adjacent nations.
Had his relatively unbroken succession of victories
made him an inexorably ruthless tyrant whose
actions were wholly prompted by an insatiable ambition,
or had they but reaffirmed his ceaselessly reiterated
claim that he was only plastic clay in Allah’s hand?
Did he delight to glut himself in wanton bloodshed, or,
in the inmost regions of his spirit, did he believe that
the punishments meted out upon his enemies had actually
been self-inflicted inasmuch as they had refused to
accept the one true God? “And He hath caused to
descend from their strongholds the Jews.... And
He struck terror into their hearts. A part ye slaughtered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[p. 175]</span>
and a part ye took into captivity. And He hath
made you to inherit their land, and their habitations,
and their wealth, and a land which ye had not trodden
upon; and God is over all things powerful.... I am
the strongest, therefore Allah is with me.” Did those
exultant words emanate from a profligate, coldly calculating
and atrociously barbarous hypocrite, or from
a humble and grateful penitent whose sole wish was
to be a channel through which Allah’s divine purposes
might be made manifest? The answer forever bides.</p>

<h3 title="Section 1">I</h3>

<p class="firstpara">Incessant wars and rumors of wars by no means occupied
all of Mohammed’s attention. He might be
prophet, statesman, general and practically king, but
he was also something more: he was a family man on
a large scale. Aloof and reserved on public occasions,
he was excessively affectionate toward his friends, and
indeed some of his wives. Since he no longer had any
small children, he was particularly fond of little tots;
while standing at prayer he sometimes held a child in
his arms, and at Medina he often allowed a little girl
to lead him around by the hand. From the plumbless
depths of his character a vast and intricate collection of
odd mannerisms, which occasionally corresponded with
the surpassing dignity of his office, came to the surface;
and all the manifold resources of psychology, philosophy
and related branches of erudition have been exhausted
in the attempt to analyze or synthesize his personality
from these <i lang="la" title="scattered fragments">disjecta membra</i>. But the dry
bones still remain scattered and unfleshed; all the prodigal
resources of modern scholarship have excavated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[p. 177]</span>
fewer vital facts about the Prophet than one of his
most favored wives or friends might have related in
less than a day. When, therefore, they speak with
voices whose authenticity is generally granted, they
should be allowed to hold the stage.</p>

<p>Ayesha, certainly, was one of them. Questioned
once about her illustrious consort, she tartly replied:
“He was a man just such as yourselves; he laughed
often and smiled much.” “But how would he occupy
himself at home?” the insistent voice continued. “Even
as any of you occupy yourselves,” came the abrupt response.
“He would mend his clothes, and cobble his
shoes. He used to help me in my household duties; but
what he did oftenest was to sew. If he had the choice
between two matters, he would always choose the easier,
so as that no sin accrued therefrom.” Ayesha obviously
had few illusions about Mohammed; but that is one of
the peculiar privileges of great men’s wives, and besides
he was her senior by more than forty years&mdash;a
fact that probably accounts very largely for her continual
underestimation of his several abilities. Her highly
partial record, accordingly, should be corrected and
supplemented with equally pertinent particulars.</p>

<p>For indeed, despite his felicity in cobbling, sewing,
milking his goats and tarring his camels, there were
many things that he did not like at all. He detested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[p. 178]</span>
lying on the part of others, and separated himself from
those of his adherents who cultivated a natural taste for
mendacity, until they repented; he held the custom of
usury in special abhorrence: “One dirhem of usury
which a man eats, knowing it to be so, is more grievous
than thirty-six fornications,” he declared. He also
loathed dogs and pictures&mdash;“Angels will not enter a
house containing a dog or pictures,” and “Every painter
will be in hell,” he oracularly announced, but the reason
for this outburst is obscure. Perhaps it was because
Arabian art was notoriously bad&mdash;and then again,
perhaps he was jealous of anything that, no matter how
rude and primitive, was entirely beyond his comprehension.
Once, during public prayers, he chanced to
notice that his mantle was richly figured, and when he
had ended he said: “Take away that mantle, for verily
it hath distracted me in my prayers, and bring me
a common one”; and on another similar occasion he
threw off a silken robe in disgust, saying, “Such stuff
it doth not become the pious to wear.” He wore a
golden ring until he noticed that all the people were
beginning to follow his example, whereupon he went
into the pulpit, pulled the ring off with the words, “By
the Lord I will not wear this ring ever again,” and then
prohibited the use of such adornments. A friend who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[p. 179]</span>
had sent him a present in the form of a steaming dinner
was much chagrined when it was returned uneaten and
even untouched by his fingers&mdash;for he “used to eat with
his thumb and his two forefingers,” and, “after he had
finished eating, he licked his blessed fingers: first the
middle one, then the prayer-finger, and last the thumb”&mdash;but
he was pacified when the Prophet explained that
he had not tasted it because onions had been cooked
with the food; for Gabriel, he went on to say, strenuously
objected to the odor of both onions and garlic.
Furthermore, he abstained from tasting lizards, for he
feared that they were descended, by some inexplicable
metempsychosis, from a certain tribe of Israel. He
commonly reclined during his meals, though sometimes
“he would sit on his left leg, posting up the right; and
if he was very hungry, he would sit down altogether and
post up both legs.”</p>

<p>Yet the catalogue of his likes was far more extensive
than the list of his aversions. He was so devoted to
everlasting prayers that his legs often became swollen
from long standing; and when anyone remonstrated
with him, he would reply: “What! Shall I not behave
as a thankful servant should?” He was very careful
not to yawn during his devotions, and if perforce
he sneezed, “he made a moderate noise, covering his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[p. 180]</span>
blessed face with his robe-sleeve and putting his blessed
hand before his nostrils,” after which he would ejaculate,
“Praise be to Allah!” Before commencing his
orisons, he always sniffed up several handfuls of water
from his right hand and then blew the liquid out with his
left hand. Ordinarily, he prayed with his shoes on,
though he once took them off while engaged in public
supplication&mdash;a deed immediately aped by the entire
audience; but the Prophet at once informed them that
their action was unnecessary, “for he had merely taken
off his own because Gabriel had apprised him that there
was some dirty substance attaching to them.” His
prayers were so earnest and vehement that “it might
be known from a distance that he was speaking by the
motion of his beard”&mdash;which he had let grow until it
reached to the middle of his broad chest; but he regularly
clipped his moustache. When it was once suggested
to him that his appearance would be vastly improved
if he reversed the process, the counselor was
properly rebuked. “Nay,” said Mohammed, “for my
Lord hath commanded me to clip the moustaches and
allow the beard to grow.”</p>

<p>In more mundane matters, too, his tastes were equally
pronounced. He affected white clothes chiefly, but
was also partial toward red, yellow and green garments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[p. 181]</span>
and he sometimes wore woolens. Scrupulously neat in
his personal habits, and ever ready to condemn untidiness
(yellow teeth, in particular) in his companions, he
yet wore a turban, wrapped many times around his
head, whose lower edge looked “like the soiled clothes
of an oil-dealer.” But such carelessness was uncommon,
for his clothes, though mostly inexpensive, were
habitually clean and neat. When he donned freshly
laundered clothes, he was accustomed to remark:
“Praise be to the Lord, who hath clothed me with that
which shall hide my nakedness and adorn me while I
live.” He had a perfect mania for toothpicks: at night
he invariably kept one handy to use before performing
his ablutions; while traveling he always carried a generous
supply; indeed, he used them so frequently between
his wide-spaced teeth, “white as hailstones,” that
he gradually wore his gums away; and one person
chanced to observe him, toothpick in mouth, making a
gurgling, “a-ccha” noise as if he were going to disgorge
his food.</p>

<p>The narrowness of his means at Medina limited his
gluttonous desires for a time, but his rapid successes
soon enabled him to feast upon delectable dainties. He
was very fond of sweetmeats, honey, cucumbers and
ripe dates (“When he ate fresh dates he would keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[p. 182]</span>
such as were bad in his hand”) and he eyed the pumpkin
with particular favor. One of his servants, gazing
abstractedly at some pumpkins one day, after Mohammed’s
death, was overheard saying “Dear little plant,
how the Prophet loved thee!” Like a true Arab, he
preferred mutton to all other flesh. “I once slew a
kid and dressed it,” narrated a Medinan. “The
Prophet asked me for the forequarter and I gave it to
him. ‘Give me another,’ he said; and I gave him the
second. Then he asked for a third. ‘O Prophet!’ I
replied, ‘there are but two forequarters to a kid.’” The
meal that he relished with most gusto, however, was “a
mess of bread cooked with meat, and a dish of dates
dressed with butter and milk.” He had a predilection
for several wells around Medina whose waters, he said,
were both “cold and sweet,” and, after he drank, he
sometimes bathed in them or invoked a blessing on their
contents by spitting into them. Close-fisted and frugal
most of the time, he readily loosed his purse-strings
when he saw something whose appeal was irresistible.
He once paid about twenty camels for a single dress,
and also gave eight golden pieces for a mantle. At
bedtime he regularly put antimony on his eyelids, “saying
that it made the sight more piercing, and caused the
hair to grow”; he had a crystal goblet with silver trimmings,
a copper vase for his baths, and an ivory comb;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[p. 183]</span>
but perhaps his chief fancy inclined toward perfumes.
“We always used to know when Mohammed had issued
forth from his chamber by the sweet perfume that filled
the air,” one of his servants testified. He indulged without
stint in musk and ambergris, and he burned camphor
on odiferous wood so that he might enjoy the smell.
With her customary acumen, Ayesha put the gist of the
matter into one pithy sentence when she said: “The
Prophet loved three things&mdash;women, scents, and food;
he had his heart’s desire of the first two, but not of the
last.” In fact, Mohammed himself argued that these
two innocuous diversions intensified the ecstasy of his
prayers.</p>


<h3 title="Section 2">II</h3>

<p>Mohammed’s adoration of particular women was
nevertheless tempered with penetrating discretion
toward the sex in general. It is true that he abrogated
the usage which permitted, and even encouraged, sons
to inherit their fathers’ wives, and that the code of Islam
allowed single ladies to be mistresses of their own actions;
but it is also true that married women continued
to be treated merely as sports and playthings for the
convenience of their husbands. “Men stand above
women,” says the Koran, “because of the superiority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[p. 184]</span>
which God hath conferred on one of them over the
other.... Wherefore let the good Women be obedient....
But such as ye may fear disobedience or provocation
from, rebuke them, and put them away in
separate apartments, and chastise them. But, if they
be obedient unto you, seek not against them an excuse
for severity; verily God is lofty and great.” While
Moslem husbands might easily obtain an absolute divorce
if they chose, the idea that women might occasionally
desire the same privilege seems never to have
entered the Prophet’s head. Women might win Paradise,
to be sure, yet no provision was made whereby they
could anticipate such captivating entertainments as
were promised to faithful men. Mohammed, in fact,
was sagacious enough to entice males to Islam by implying
that there would be no occasion for them to
lament the loss of their wives in Paradise: “Whenever
a woman vexes her husband in this world, his wife
among the Houris of Paradise says: ‘Do not vex him
(May God slay thee!) for he is only a guest with thee.
He will soon leave thee and come to us’”&mdash;and indeed,
the most subtly cruel punishment that the Prophet ever
inflicted upon erring males was to separate them for a
period from their wives. If, however, some wives remained
refractory in the face of this warning, Mohammed
had still another card up his sleeve: “If a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[p. 185]</span>
summon his wife to his bed and she refuse to come, so
that he spends the night in anger, the angels curse her
till morning.”</p>

<p>That the Prophet, as was only natural, allowed himself
a wider latitude of encounters than was granted to
his adherents&mdash;who might espouse only four women,
but might also form liaisons “without antecedent ceremony
or any guarantee of continuance” with any number
of female slaves&mdash;was made clear by Ayesha. “I
was jealous of the women who gave themselves to the
apostle of God,” she admitted, “and said, ‘Does a
woman give herself?’ Then when God revealed:
‘Thou mayst decline for the present whom thou wilt of
them, and thou mayst take to thy bed her whom thou
wilt, and whomsoever thou shalt long for of those thou
shalt have before neglected; and this shall not be a crime
in thee.’ I said, ‘I see your Lord does nothing but
hasten to fulfil your desire!’” Yet due allowance
should be made for Ayesha’s jealousy; for, while Mohammed
married approximately twelve women, she was
the only virgin among them&mdash;the others were widows
or divorcees who commonly brought him wealth or desirable
political connections. For indeed, though he
once playfully chided a Moslem who had married a
mature woman instead of a “young damsel, who would
have sported with thee, and thou with her,” he was too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[p. 186]</span>
canny to follow his own counsel. At the same time, he
preferred women of spirit; in fact, he definitely rejected
one girl because “she never cried or complained”&mdash;a
criticism that certainly could not be aimed against
most of his brides.</p>

<p>Khadija was barely under ground when the Prophet
prepared to embark boldly upon matrimonial seas.
About two months later he married Sauda, a tall, corpulent,
mature widow whose brother celebrated the event
by sprinkling ashes on his head; he synchronously engaged
himself to Abu Bekr’s daughter Ayesha, whom
he eventually espoused at the age of ten; but it has been
suggested that “there may have been something more
than ordinarily precocious about the child.” She herself
attributed her hold on Mohammed’s affections not
only to her childish beauty, but to her plumpness.
“When I was betrothed to the Prophet,” she related,
“my mother endeavored to make me fat; and she found
that with me nothing succeeded so well as gourds and
fresh dates. Eating well of them I became round”;
yet, as she grew up, she lost her flesh and became thin
and willowy. In 624 Omar found himself with Hafsa,
a widowed daughter of twenty, upon his hands. Irritated
and scandalized by her exhaustive but fruitless
endeavors to win a second husband, he offered her in
turn to Othman and Abu Bekr, who, knowing that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[p. 187]</span>
inherited her father’s cranky temper, refused to accept
the honor. Omar was so insulted by this double rebuff
that he at once flew angrily to Mohammed to make a
complaint. The Prophet, at his wit’s end because of
the social uproar that had been started, saved the situation
by marrying Hafsa himself, and thus abundantly
gratified his wish to have a wife who cried and complained
all the time. Zeinab, widow of one of the heroes
of Bedr, became his fifth wife in 626; her gentle and
charitable disposition perhaps accounts for the fact that
she was the only one of his wives who preceded him to
Paradise. His sixth bride was won in a peculiar way.
As Abu Selama lay expiring of a wound received at
Uhud, Mohammed entered and quieted the wailing
women with this prayer: “O Lord! give unto him
width and comfort in his grave; lighten his darkness;
pardon his sins; and raise up faithful followers from his
seed.” Just four months later (626), the Prophet
pressed his ardent suit upon Abu’s widow Um, who,
against her better judgment, finally yielded to his importunity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the much-married man had discovered
that his domestic arrangements were getting more and
more complicated. Founding a precedent that has
since been followed by many Christian churches, he occupied
a part of the Mosque. His domestic quarters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[p. 188]</span>
were established along its eastern wall; they seem to
have been constructed from a series of adjacent huts
owned by one Haritha, who retired more or less willingly
from each of them whenever Mohammed needed
a new shelter for a bride; and as the years passed, poor
Haritha would barely fix up a new abode before he was
shoved out of it. An entrance for the Prophet’s exclusive
use led from each dwelling into the Mosque;
having no separate apartment for himself, he rotated
daily from one hut to the other according to a fixed
schedule: “the day of Hafsa, the day of Um,” <i lang="la" title="to the very end">ad finem</i>.
Before long, however, he deliberately infringed upon
the rights of all his other wives by breaking the routine
in favor of Ayesha&mdash;the now lithe and lissom beauty
who still toyed with her playthings and frolicked with
Mohammed in nursery games&mdash;until the deserted wives
raised such a squabble that he was forced to emit the
famous revelation, so cuttingly commented on by
Ayesha, which gave him license to consort with her
who pleased him most at the moment.</p>

<p>Conflicting reports have been handed down concerning
the acquisition of the Prophet’s seventh bride. Going
one day to visit his adopted son Zeid, who was
absent, he was invited in by Zeid’s wife Zeinab, who
... but here the tales diverge. Some say that Mohammed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[p. 189]</span>
merely saw her unveiled face, while others assert
that her carelessly disarranged dress gave him
further glimpses; some say that the Prophet, moved by
a purely artistic admiration of her beauty, uttered the
words, “Praise be to God, the ruler of hearts!” but
others insist that his approbation was of a lower sort,
and translate his ejaculation thus: “Gracious Lord!
Good Heavens! how Thou dost turn the hearts of men!”
It is agreed, however, that Zeinab was so elated at the
impression she had made on the Prophet’s facile susceptibility
to feminine wiles that she took special pains
to repeat his compliment over and over to Zeid, who, in
addition to being short, pug-nosed and generally ugly,
was a mere freedman, and, therefore, had never appealed
too strongly to his high-born wife. Hot with jealousy,
Zeid went to Mohammed and declared that he wished
to divorce Zeinab. “Why,” he was asked, “hast thou
found any fault in her?” “No,” groaned Zeid, “but I
cannot live with her.” “Go and guard thy wife,” he
was told, “treat her well and fear God.” But Zeid,
who presumably saw how matters lay, soon divorced her
“in spite of the command of the Prophet,” remarks
an admirer, who goes on to explain that Mohammed
“was grieved at the conduct of Zeid, more especially as
it was he who had arranged the marriage of these two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[p. 190]</span>
uncongenial spirits.” Obviously, the trouble could be
mended in but one way. One day, as Mohammed sat
by Ayesha’s side, a prophetic spasm gripped him; after
it had passed, he smiled and gently inquired, “Who
will go and congratulate Zeinab, and say that the Lord
hath joined her unto me in marriage?” The wedding
soon took place; yet, since many Moslems thought it
rather odd that the Prophet, after forbidding sons to
wed their bereaved stepmothers, should himself marry
the wife of an adopted son, it seemed highly advisable
for him to have recourse to Allah. Thus runs the
Koran: “And when Zeid had fulfilled her [Zeinab’s]
divorce, We joined thee with her in marriage, that there
might hereafter be no offence to Believers in marrying
the Wives of their adopted sons, when they have fulfilled
their divorce; and the command of God is to be
fulfilled.” Criticism immediately collapsed. Zeinab
proudly boasted that “God had given her in marriage
to His Prophet, whereas his other wives were given to
him by their relatives”; but Ayesha retorted with the
caustic observation that there was no longer the least
doubt that Mohammed rendered Allah’s messages verbatim,
inasmuch as this last revelation showed the
Prophet up most unmercifully. Ayesha, however, was
one woman in a thousand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[p. 191]</span></p>


<h3 title="Section 3">III</h3>

<p>By this time Mohammed had come to be regarded as
a highly desirable catch by every widow in Medina,
while attractive women came from all the corners of
Arabia to offer themselves to the impressionable man.
His inordinate masculinity prompted the other Moslems
to justify his excess of brides on the judicious
ground that his “Excellency had the power of thirty
strong men given him”&mdash;a consideration that was
esteemed by certain discriminating traditionalists to be
a proof of what has been characterized as the Prophet’s
“divinely conferred preëminence.” In short, he was
every inch a man. His spare, well-moulded figure was
tall and commanding; he walked so fast that his gait
has been compared to that of a man ascending a hill,
or of one “wrenching his foot from a stone,” and this
rapid locomotion made him unconsciously bend his back
until in his last years he became round-shouldered.
“That blessed prince’s head was large,” we are told,
“and yet he was not big-headed.” His face was lean
and rosy, his skin was clear and “soft as woman’s,” his
slightly Roman nose was thin and shapely&mdash;some
people “might regard his nasal bone as exceedingly
long, though in reality it was not so”&mdash;his neck, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[p. 192]</span>
unimpeachable authority of Ali, was “like that of a
silver urn,” and “his blessed mouth was open, but exceedingly
graceful.” The quality and abundance of
his ebon hair has been explained in great detail. Thick
and curly masses of it&mdash;“not very frizzled or very
dangling but just right”&mdash;hung about his ears; his vast
expanse of beard presumably concealed from vulgar
eyes an otherwise conspicuous peculiarity: “from his
chest down to the navel there was drawn a thin line of
hair, while the other parts of the chest and stomach
were hairless, although there was hair on his blessed
arms and shoulders and the upper part of his chest.”
Even in his slumbers he retained his appearance of ease
and grace, for he “lay on his right side, putting the
palm of his right hand under his right cheek.” An
admirer summed up his manly comeliness in this poetic
outburst: “I saw him at full moon, and he was brighter
and more beautiful than she,” and another charming
tradition affirms that no fly ever alighted on his body.
Yet the handsome man was not flawless. The penetrating
eyes, fringed with long and lustrous lashes, were
red-lidded and bloodshot; ugly gaps disfigured his
dazzling white teeth; and on his back was a birthmark
which, though held to be the divine “seal of prophecy”
that distinguished him as the last of the authentic
prophets, was probably a large mole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[p. 193]</span></p>

<p>Encompassed by six wives and two slave concubines,
Mohammed soon discovered that the most energetic efforts
were required to provide for their wishes. They
not only made a heavy drain on his purse and his larder,
but upon his patience; for, while he was rapidly ageing,
several of them were just nearing the height of feminine
attractiveness, and many youthful Moslems, envious of
the conjugal liberties which Mohammed so prodigally
claimed, were in the habit of calling at one or another
of his houses on matters that had little to do with religion.
The favorite, Ayesha, soon got into a scrape
that turned his suspicions into open jealousy. She had
accompanied him on one of his martial expeditions&mdash;a
custom of which his other brides frequently availed
themselves by the casting of lots, Ayesha being the
fortunate winner on this occasion&mdash;in a vehicle drawn by
a camel and punctiliously veiled from view; and, after
he had victoriously returned to Medina and the cart was
opened, he discovered to his great horror that she was
not inside. When she came up a little later, escorted
by young Safwan, she explained that she had lost her
necklace, had gone to search for it, and upon her return
had found that her guides, thinking that she was inside,
had guided the camel and its supposed burden
back to Medina. Shortly afterward, she continued,
Safwan had chanced to meet her, “expressed surprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[p. 194]</span>
at finding one of the Prophet’s wives in this predicament,”
and, upon receiving no reply from the virtuous
maiden, had asked her to mount his camel; as she shyly
complied, he had averted his face so that he did not see
her ascend the beast, and not a word had passed between
them on the return journey. No one knows what Mohammed
might have done had not scandalous tongues
started to wag; but wag they did, and the poor girl,
noticing her husband’s cold demeanor, promptly fell
ill and went to visit her father. The Prophet meanwhile
was much disturbed, for the business was very
complicated. Should he punish the daughter of Abu
Bekr, his most valued and intimate friend, trouble
would almost certainly follow; on the other hand, such
fellows as Abdallah ibn Obei and the poet Hassan could
not be permitted to go around making lewd jokes at his
expense. So, visiting Ayesha in the presence of her
father and mother, he said: “Ayesha! thou hearest
what men have spoken of thee. Fear God. If indeed
thou art guilty, then repent toward God, for the Lord
accepteth the repentance of His servants.” The grief-stricken
girl burst out weeping and replied: “By the
Lord! I say that I will never repent towards God of
that which ye speak of. I am helpless. If I confess,
God knoweth that I am not guilty. If I deny, no one
believeth me.” In this dire predicament, the Prophet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[p. 195]</span>
fortunately fell into a profound trance; upon his recovery,
he wiped great beads of sweat from his brow
and exclaimed: “Ayesha! rejoice! Verily, the Lord
hath declared thine innocence.” “Embrace thine husband!”
cried Abu’s wife, but Ayesha contented herself
with the ejaculation, “Praise be to the Lord”&mdash;in
Whom she apparently recognized a capacity for chivalry
that was foreign to her husband. And one night not
long afterward, hoping perhaps to turn the tables on
him, she secretly followed him when he slipped quietly
out of the house on what seemed to be an amorous expedition;
but she was grievously disappointed upon discovering
that he was bent upon no more exciting errand
than going to a graveyard to offer up prayers for
the dead.</p>

<p>Thus the affair ended. Mohammed, however, immediately
improvised a law that imposed a severe
scourging upon scandal-mongers who failed to produce
four witnesses to substantiate any charge of whoredom&mdash;a
penalty that was at once inflicted upon Hassan, another
man named Mistah, and even one of the Prophet’s
sisters-in-law; but he dared not treat Abdallah ibn Obei
thus. Hassan, moreover, had already been badly
wounded by the indignant Safwan; and so Mohammed,
who really loved the incorrigibly mischievous versifier,
salved his double hurts by presenting him a costly piece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[p. 196]</span>
of property and a concubine. The grateful fellow immediately
manufactured new stanzas in praise of
Ayesha’s purity, her pert humor, and her supple figure&mdash;a
series of compliments to which she had the bad grace
to retort that the poet himself was disgustingly fat.</p>

<p>Nor did Mohammed stop here; he quickly proceeded
to bring about other equally desirable reforms. The
institution of the Veil for women&mdash;a custom, already
not unknown, whose origin was probably due to the
common superstitious fear of the horrific “evil eye”&mdash;was
now imposed upon his harem; and the Koran also
made it clear that the day of Moslem peeping Toms
was over. “O ye believers! Enter not the apartments
of the Prophet, except ye be called to sup with him,
without waiting his convenient time.... And stay not
for familiar converse; for verily that giveth uneasiness
to the Prophet. It shameth him to say this unto you;
but verily God is not ashamed of the Truth. And when
ye ask anything of the Prophet’s wives, ask it of them
from behind a curtain; this will be more pure for your
hearts and for their hearts. It is not fitting that ye
should give uneasiness to the Apostle of God, nor that
ye should marry his Wives after him for ever. Verily
that would be a grievous thing in the sight of God....
The Prophet is nearer unto the Believers than their own
souls, and his Wives are their Mothers.” All Moslem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[p. 197]</span>
women, furthermore, were commanded to veil themselves,
at home or while walking abroad, from the prying
eyes of everyone except a rich variety of relatives.
“And say to the believing women that they cast down
their looks and guard their private parts and display
not their ornaments except what appears thereof, and
let them wear their head-coverings over their bosoms,
and not display their ornaments except to their husbands
or their fathers, or the fathers of their husbands,
or their sons, or the sons of their husbands, or their
brothers, or their brothers’ sons, or their sisters’ sons,
or their women, or those whom their right hands
possess, or the male servants not having need (of
women), or the children who have not attained knowledge
of what is hidden of women ... and turn to Allah,
O Believers! so that you may be successful.”</p>


<h3 title="Section 4">IV</h3>

<p>Yet somehow or other, despite all his efforts to do
Allah’s will, the Prophet’s wives still continued to be
rebellious and even fractious. Sadly unmindful of her
recent misadventure, Ayesha in particular continued to
be as saucy and impudent as ever. When in her distress
she had gone to her parents, Ali, who next to Abu
Bekr was Mohammed’s bosom friend, had consoled him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[p. 198]</span>
in this way: “O Prophet! there is no lack of women,
and thou canst without difficulty supply her place.”
Upon hearing of this, Ayesha took a temporary revenge
by shouting in Mohammed’s very face that he liked Ali
better than her own father, and a permanent one by
treating Ali like a dog for the rest of his life. It
chanced, however, that Abu Bekr overheard his vixenish
daughter thus berating her husband; utterly unmoved
by the fact that she had been standing up for
him, Abu at once rushed in and roared, “I will not hear
thee lift thy voice against the apostle of God!” But
when he seized her and lifted his hand to slap her face,
Mohammed interfered; so Abu went away in a foaming
rage, while the Prophet heaped coals of fire on
Ayesha’s head with the comment, “You see how I delivered
you from the man.” Abu continued to growl
and grumble for several days, but eventually returned
to find the pair completely reconciled. “Include me
in your peace as you included me in your quarrel!” he
begged; and Mohammed joyfully answered, “We do,
we do!” But perhaps Ayesha provoked the Prophet
most of all by failing to treat his religious views with
proper decorum; when she was particularly miffed
about something, she showed her disrespect by refusing
to address him as the “Apostle of God.” Once he
unwisely told her that, on the day of judgment, all mankind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[p. 199]</span>
would be raised in the same condition as they had
been born&mdash;naked, barefooted and uncircumcised. She
immediately interrupted his disquisition with the remark
that, if this were so, immodest thoughts would prevail,
and all that he could think of to say in reply to her
untimely jest was that “the business of the day would
be too weighty and serious to allow them the making
use of that liberty.” With an even more lamentable
lack of judgment, he once commented on his great love
for Khadija&mdash;an indiscretion that brought the swift retort:
“Was she not old? Has not God given you a
better in her place?” “No, by God!” exclaimed the
homesick man, “there can never be a better! She believed
in me, when men despised me; she relieved my
wants, when I was poor and persecuted by the world.”</p>

<p>Besides Ayesha’s shrewishness, too, he was forced
to endure mean tricks used by some of his other pestering
wives, who, knowing his strong aversion to such
smells as onion and garlic, sometimes took pains to
eat malodorous foods. In his perplexity he devised
various avenues of escape; but even the horse-races
and the performances of singing-girls, which he not
infrequently included in his list of pleasures, afforded
him little lasting relief. There was some solace, however,
in the fact that many of his famous followers were
also stung by domestic broils. Abu Bekr and Omar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[p. 200]</span>
coming one day to visit the Prophet, found him gloomy
and glum in the midst of his family. After Omar had
made the aside remark, “I must say something to make
the Prophet laugh,” he began thus: “O Apostle of
God, if I see Bint Kharija [his wife] asking me for
money I get up and throttle her!” Mohammed, immensely
tickled in spite of himself, replied, “These
women about me, as you see, are asking for money.”
Abu Bekr immediately bounded up and started to choke
Ayesha; Omar also seized his daughter Hafsa by the
throat and savagely demanded, “Will you ask the
Apostle of God for what he does not possess?”&mdash;upon
which both women simultaneously gasped, “By God,
we will never ask him for anything he does not possess!”
This incident seems to have taught Mohammed
how to manage his women better. Having first absented
himself from their ministrations for about a
month, he appeared with a new string of commandments.
“O Prophet, say unto thy Wives&mdash;If ye seek
after this present Life and the fashion thereof, come, I
will make provision for you and dismiss you with a fair
dismission. But if ye seek after God and His Apostle,
and the Life to come, then verily God hath prepared for
the excellent amongst you a great reward. O ye Wives
of the Prophet! if any amongst you should be guilty of
incontinence, the punishment shall be doubled unto her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[p. 201]</span>
twofold; and that were easy with God.... Ye are not
as other women.... And abide within your houses;
and array not yourselves as ye used to do in the bygone
days of ignorance. And observe the times of Prayer;
and give Alms; and obey God and His Apostle.”</p>

<p>After this the air cleared somewhat, so that Mohammed
enjoyed a temporary peace; yet it was not long before
he incontinently got himself into another scrape.
His harem had not particularly objected when he took
four other brides in fairly rapid succession&mdash;Juweiriya
and Safiya, both captives taken in war; Um Habiba, the
daughter, <i lang="la" title="wonderful to relate">mirabile dictu</i>, of Abu Sufyan; and the beauteous
Meimuna, the sister-in-law of his uncle Al-Abbas,&mdash;but
when his wives discovered that one of his latest
concubines, Mary the Coptic maid, was about to become
a mother, confusion was worse confounded. For they
knew that, above all else, Mohammed desired a son: he
had no living boy, he was naturally affectionate, and he
suffered agonies from his enemies who applied to him
the sobriquet “al-abtar,” which means one without
descendants, or, translated literally, “one whose tail has
been cut off.” When in the course of time Mary gave
birth to a son, who was named Ibrahim, she was raised
from the status of a slave to a position almost on par
with her “Sisters”; and Mohammed, overjoyed at his
long frustrated good fortune, immediately shaved his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[p. 202]</span>
head&mdash;which had been shorn about a month before&mdash;weighed
the snippings, and distributed among the poor
a corresponding weight of silver. He was also foolish
enough to carry his little son to Ayesha and to burst
out, in the fulness of parental pride, “Look, what a likeness
it is to me!” “I do not see it,” snapped Ayesha.
“What!” he cried, “canst thou not see the likeness, and
how fair and fat he is?” “Yes, and so would be any
other child that drank as much milk as he,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>Not long afterward he was even more imprudent.
Hafsa, chancing one day to find the Prophet and Mary
in her own particular apartment, lashed out her ever
ready tongue at him, and promised that she would tell
all his other wives without delay. Mohammed, frightened
even more than he had ever been on a battlefield,
humbly prayed her to keep quiet and agreed to leave
Mary for good; but Hafsa, utterly unable to keep such
a flagrant breach of domestic etiquette to herself, at
once told Ayesha who of course promptly informed all
the other “Sisters.” The Prophet, discovering that
home life was now absolutely unendurable, once more
went into retirement for about a month. He was comforted
in his seclusion by both Mary and Allah, one of
whom suggested that this passage should be added to
the Koran: “Maybe, his Lord, if he divorce you, will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[p. 203]</span>
give him in your place wives better than you, submissive,
faithful, obedient, penitent, adorers, fasters, virgins.”
But this threat of wholesale divorce does not
appear to have worried the enraged women so much as
it did their relatives; Abu Bekr and Omar, for instance,
were much upset upon learning that their chief should
have deserted their daughters in favor of an ex-slave
concubine. At this juncture Gabriel luckily appeared
on the scene; he informed Mohammed that Hafsa, after
all, was a fairly good woman and advised him to take
her back. Thus, in fact, the breach was healed; but impartiality
necessitates the inclusion of a statement by
Mohammed’s most adequate modern defender, who
swears that the whole episode was an “absolutely false
and malicious” invention of the Prophet’s enemies.
He goes on to say that the passage in the Koran which
deals with the affair actually refers to Mohammed’s
fondness for honey: Hafsa and Ayesha persuaded him
to forego it; but then “came the thought that he was
making something unlawful in which there was nothing
unlawful, simply to please his wives.” Thus the
Prophet, it is to be inferred, thought that honey was
more precious than ten legal brides.</p>

<p>In any case, harmony was restored. Mohammed,
worn and haggard from his domestic tribulations, was
soon restored to health and amused himself by watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[p. 204]</span>
the antics of his growing boy. But when Ibrahim
was yet hardly able to toddle around, he began to pine
away. Just before his decease, the Prophet clasped
him in his arms and sobbed bitterly; when the other
watchers endeavored to console him by recalling his own
strong objection to the outward expression of grief, he
replied in a broken voice: “Nay, it is not this that I
forbade, but wailing and fulsome laudation of the dead....
We grieve for the child: the eye runneth down
with tears, and the heart swelleth inwardly; yet we say
not aught that would offend our Lord. Ibrahim! O
Ibrahim!” For the child had died while his father was
talking, and, after making the observation, “The remainder
of the days of his nursing shall be fulfilled in
Paradise,” Mohammed tenderly comforted Mary.
Speechless and heavy-eyed, he kept a steadfast guard
while the body was washed and laid out; then he prayed
over it and finally followed the procession to the little
grave. After it had been filled with earth, he sprinkled
fresh water upon the mound and spoke these words:
“When ye do this thing, do it carefully, for it giveth
ease to the afflicted heart. It cannot injure the dead,
neither can it profit him; but it giveth comfort to the
living.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak chaphdg"><span title="Chapter 9">IX</span><br><br><br>THE TRIUMPHANT RETURN</h2>
</div>

<h3 title="Section 1">I</h3>

<p class="firstpara">Six long years, with their burden of foreign and
domestic struggles, had elapsed since the Hegira; yet
the recollections of Mecca, the Kaba, the Black Stone&mdash;in
short, the memories of <em>home</em>&mdash;had remained ineradicably
fixed in the minds of the Prophet and his flock.
About half of Arabia, and approximately three-fourths
of his wives, might now be pretty well under his
dominion; but his heart often troubled him when he recalled
his sins of omission in failing to fulfil the Lesser
and Greater Pilgrimages&mdash;and, incidentally, the hateful
truth that the intransigent Koreish still ruled the
beloved city. Why, therefore, should he not undertake
a pilgrimage during one of the sacred months? for
surely, the mere fact that he himself had previously
violated their sanctity could not rightly be held against
him if he returned as a humble penitent. The Koreish,
bound by adamant Arabian custom, would almost
certainly allow him and his followers to make their
sacrifices to the national religion; and, even in case his
ancient foes should molest the journeying Moslems,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[p. 206]</span>
perhaps&mdash;<em>perhaps</em>&mdash;he would be able to deal with them.</p>

<p>In a dream he imagined himself and his worshiping
band going through the stiff ritual of pilgrimage: encircling
the Kaba, slaughtering the sacrificial victims,
and completing the other well-remembered ceremonies.
The Moslems, after listening to his fervid narration
of this vision, pulsated with desire to accompany him;
and so, having taken a bath and donned the two-piece
pilgrim garb, in February, 628, he set out, mounted
on Al-Kaswa, at the head of some fifteen hundred
votaries each of whom was armed with a sword, a bow
and a quiver of arrows. At one stage of the journey
they halted and, uttering the plaintive cry “Labbeik!
Labbeik! (Here am I, O Lord! Here am I!),”
placed their curious ornaments around the necks of
seventy votive camels. In the busy midst of these pious
engagements, however, the Prophet did not neglect to
dispatch a spy to report on the behavior of the Koreish;
the envoy finally returned with the news that the
Meccans were obviously distrustful of Mohammed’s
peacefully religious intentions, and that, in very truth,
a large body of armed Koreish was guarding the road
that led to Mecca. “Their wives and little ones are
with them,” said the spy, “and they have sworn to die
rather than let thee pass,” adding the further detail that
they were clothed in panthers’ skins&mdash;a symbol of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[p. 207]</span>
determination to fight like beasts in an effort to bar any
advance. Mohammed and his people therefore decided
to continue toward Mecca by a sinuous route that would
lead them to the edge of the sacred city. At this
juncture Al-Kaswa stopped short and refused to budge
another inch. “She is weary,” the Moslems insisted;
but the Prophet replied: “Nay, Al-Kaswa is not
weary; but the same hand restraineth her as aforetime
held back the elephant”&mdash;for, as became a loyal Arab,
he had not forgotten how Arabia had been saved from
the invader Abraha. He further declared that he
would not march upon the city, for fear that the few
Moslems who were still living there might chance to be
harmed in the struggle that might take place; but it is
also possible that he checked his advance because he had
learnt that the Koreish, hearing of his own manœuver,
had also deviated in such a way that they still blocked
his path.</p>

<p>Very soon afterward, a Koreishite deputation approached
to interview Mohammed. “I have no other
design but to perform the pilgrimage of the Holy
House,” he insisted, “and whosoever hindereth us therefrom,
we shall fight against them.” This sally was met
by the retort that the desperate Meccans “will not suffer
this rabble of thine to approach the city.” A long,
wrangling dispute followed in which blows came near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[p. 208]</span>
being struck; and the only concession that the Prophet
could obtain was the information that “this year he must
go back; but in the year following he may come, and
having entered Mecca then perform the pilgrimage.”
Mohammed, who realized that his acquiescence to these
instructions would irreparably harm his prestige, decided
to send a counter delegation to Mecca. Omar
was the first man requested to act in this capacity; but
that fearless fighter begged off on the plea that he had
no powerful relatives in the city to protect him against
the Koreish, and, pointing to Othman&mdash;whose slight
to Hafsa had not been forgotten&mdash;suggested that <em>he</em>
be the Moslem representative. Othman had excused
himself from fighting at Bedr on the grounds that his
wife, the Prophet’s own daughter, was ill; but, realizing
that the influence of his family connections would
protect him on this occasion, he readily consented to
depart. His return was so long delayed that Mohammed
feared he might have been treacherously slain, and
a tensely dramatic scene took place. The Prophet,
standing beneath an acacia tree and encircled by the entire
number of his votaries, requested a solemn pledge
that they would not turn their backs, but, if necessary,
would fight till the last man dropped; the covenant
was individually sealed as each man clasped Mohammed’s
outstretched hand&mdash;when Othman suddenly appeared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[p. 209]</span>
entirely unharmed. Nevertheless, the Prophet
was immensely pleased; indeed, he never ceased to refer
to this auspicious event, which had symbolized the
strength of the union of religious ecstasy and martial
enthusiasm that dominated his willing slaves.</p>

<p>A treaty of peace was eventually drawn up. For
ten years the Koreish caravans were to be unmolested,
and during this same period extraneous clans could be
converted either to Islam or to the faith&mdash;such as it was&mdash;of
Mecca; in the following year, also, the Moslems
were to be allowed to complete their pilgrimage, but this
year they must return unedified and still burdened with
their sins. Perhaps Mohammed swallowed this bitter
medicine the more readily because previous experience
had taught him that treaties were mere scraps of paper;
yet he found it excessively irritating to endure the high-handed
methods of the noted orator Suheil, ambassador
for the Koreish. The Prophet, assuming as a matter
of course that he himself should phrase the language of
the covenant, began to dictate to Ali, who willingly
served as a scribe, in this high-flown manner: “In the
name of God, most gracious and merciful”&mdash;“Stop!”
Suheil abruptly interrupted, “as for God, we know
Him; but this new name, we know it not. Say, as we
have always said, <em>In thy name, O God!</em>” “In thy
name, O God,” Mohammed repeated, “These are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[p. 210]</span>
conditions of peace between Mohammed the Prophet of
God and”&mdash;“Stop again!” commanded the imperturbable
spokesman. “If thou wert what thou sayest, I had
not taken up arms against thee. Write, as the custom
is, thine own name and thy father’s name.” “Write,
then,” said the amazed but ever tactful Prophet, “between
Mohammed son of Abdallah, and Suheil son of
Amr....” and so on until the end. The document
was then duly witnessed by members of both factions;
and Mohammed, firmly resolved to perform at least a
modicum of his vows, shaved his head (or cut his hair;
historians have not determined the facts about the matter),
and, while all the Moslems treated their heads in
a similar manner, he directed that the doomed camels
should be sacrificed.</p>

<p>The unexpected outcome of this journey left many
Moslems unsatisfied. Some of them&mdash;both the “Shavers”
and the “Cutters”&mdash;had refused to part with their
hair until the Prophet ordered them to do so; Omar,
in particular, had so completely recovered the strength
of his trembling knees that he threatened to head a
renegade movement. Obviously, therefore, it was
high time to produce a new message from on high.
Even before the return journey was begun, the words
“Inspiration hath descended on him” were eagerly repeated
throughout the encampment, and a great crowd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[p. 211]</span>
collected around the Prophet, who, standing upright on
Al-Kaswa’s broad back, began to intone thus: “Verily,
We have given unto thee an evident Victory,” adding,
at the end of a tediously prolix mass of jubilantly
phrased but wholly unintelligible rhetoric: “Now hath
God verified unto His Apostle the Vision in truth; ye
shall surely enter the Holy Temple, if it please God, in
security, having your heads shaven and your hair cut.
Fear ye not; for He knoweth that which ye know not.”
As he concluded, one of the onlookers exclaimed,
“What! is <em>this</em> the Victory?” “Yes,” came the calm
reply, “by Him in whose hand is my breath, it is a
Victory.” And in fact, despite the Prophet’s muddy-mindedness
on this occasion, there was much to justify
his statement. Perhaps he realized that the peaceful
outcome of his pompous expedition, which was certain
to be noised over a large part of Arabia, would win him
more converts than force had ever done&mdash;for had he
not convinced the Koreish of his pacific intentions, and
had <em>they</em> not treated him with high honor? Thus, indeed,
it turned out; various tribes, hoodwinked by
highly colored accounts of the pilgrimage, at once
sought to make alliances with Mohammed; and the
result was that, during the next year, Islam grew as it
had never grown before.</p>

<p>Two interesting incidents took place soon after Mohammed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[p. 212]</span>
had returned to Medina. Abu Basir, a youthful
acolyte of Islam who still lived in Mecca, became
so restless under the domination of the Koreish that,
after a series of bold assaults and hairbreadth escapes,
he managed to reach Medina in safety; the Prophet was
so much stirred by the lad’s tale of rash but admirable
bravery that he commented, as if speaking to himself:
“What a kindler of war, if he had but with him a body
of adherents!” Abu Basir, encouraged by these words,
at once organized a band of seventy similarly inclined
young braves who, for the next few months, assaulted
Koreishite caravans and killed the captives with so
much gusto that Mohammed, at the humble request of
the Meccans, finally felt constrained to command the
robbers to cease from kindling war. The second event
was of an entirely different sort. Some of the Medinese
Jews, who had openly and loudly proclaimed their
adherence to Islam, surreptitiously obtained several of
the Prophet’s blessed hairs, and, after tying them into
eleven knots around the branch of a palm-tree, lowered
the evil invention into a well. Their sly and malignant
design was soon rewarded: Mohammed grew feeble, his
mind became afflicted with stranger hallucinations than
ever before, he neglected his devotions, and he even
showed indifference toward his wives. But Gabriel
shortly revealed the cause of his malady; the well was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[p. 213]</span>
examined, the necromantic knots were loosed, and the
Prophet, thus freed from the voodooistic spell, experienced
a lively recrudescence of his manifold talents.</p>

<p>The time finally drew near when, according to the
terms of the treaty, the Koreish were to evacuate
Mecca for three days so that the Moslems might perform
their pilgrimage in peace. On this occasion about
two thousand zealots accompanied Mohammed, and,
although each one was restricted by treaty to carry only
a sword, a large amount of armor was taken along,
while the travelers were also preceded by a considerable
force of cavalry. As the procession approached
the holy city, the Koreish obediently withdrew and, stationed
on the surrounding hills, kept a wary eye on the
curious scenes that followed. The eager devotees,
upon viewing the deeply revered Kaba again for the
first time in seven years, raised the now almost joyous
ululation, “Labbeik! Labbeik!” Mohammed, astride
Al-Kaswa as usual, neared the Kaba, gently touched
the Black Stone with his staff, and&mdash;apparently still
mounted on Al-Kaswa&mdash;went seven times around the
sacred temple. His absorption in these reverent pursuits,
however, did not cause him to forget more important
concerns: at his special bidding, the Moslems
footraced around the Kaba three times at top speed, to
demonstrate to the observant Koreish that they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[p. 214]</span>
in excellent physical condition; then, at a somewhat
slower pace, they circled the building four times more.</p>

<p>Three days were occupied in fulfilling the remaining
rites; yet the Prophet, who, through the aid of Al-Kaswa,
had kept himself fresher than his foot-sore compatriots,
and who had meanwhile taken the opportunity
to engage himself to Meimuna, continued to tarry in
apparent forgetfulness of his sworn promise to leave
the city on the third day. He was brought rudely to
his senses on the morning of the fourth day, when two
leaders of the Koreish came abruptly up and said:
“The period allowed thee hath elapsed; depart now
therefore from amongst us.” “And what harm if ye allowed
me to stay a little longer,” Mohammed graciously
inquired, “celebrate my nuptials in your midst, and
make for the guests a feast at which ye too might
all sit down?” “Nay,” was the harsh answer, “of
any food of thine we have no need. Withdraw from
hence!” To disobey was to invite an immediate war;
and inasmuch as the Prophet was not yet ready for the
struggle that, in his heart of hearts, he had long anticipated,
he directed that an immediate departure be
made&mdash;a stipulation that compelled him to content himself
with the consummation of his nuptials at a spot
about ten miles from Mecca.</p>

<p>But, despite its somewhat inglorious conclusion, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[p. 215]</span>
grandiose adventure accomplished several things of
much importance. In a general way, Mohammed
benefited from the fact that the Koreish had not failed
to be impressed by the dignified yet ominous Moslemite
display of religious and warlike ardor. With their
own eyes, they had seen what an exalted rank the renegade
Prophet had attained among his servile henchmen;
they had noted, too, the instantaneous and unquestioning
obedience with which his least desire had been met.
He profited, also, in that the deepest instincts of his
confederates had been aroused at the renewed visitation
of the familiar and unforgettable scenes of those happy,
bygone days when they had dwelt in peace and
moderate prosperity at Mecca, until the implacable requirements
of Islam had wrenched them from their
cherished moorings. Once again they had been irresistibly
compelled to realize that they were but outcasts
and wanderers, to whom Medina had never grown
really congenial, and who now poignantly reflected that
Mecca, and Mecca alone, was home. In particular,
the Prophet gained two notable converts to Islam:
Khalid, who had commanded the cavalry that brought
about the Moslem defeat at Uhud, and Amr&mdash;who was
equally versatile in poetry, diplomacy, and military
strategy&mdash;were so impressed by Mohammed’s magnificent
gesture in conducting the Moslems to Mecca that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[p. 216]</span>
they decided to desert the vacillating Koreish and cast
their fortunes with the progressive cause of Islam.
Under the Caliphs who succeeded the Prophet, the intrepid
Khalid&mdash;divinely protected by some of Mohammed’s
hair which he wore in his cap as a charm against
misfortune&mdash;won such imperial victories that he acquired
the title “The Sword of Allah”; and the
sagacious counsels of Amr also won him a high place
in the annals of Islam. Furthermore, the accession of
these two was not without its immediate effect. They
were straws that showed how the wind was veering:
the Koreish had not only failed to recover the prestige
they had dropped at Bedr, and to benefit by the Moslem
debacle at Uhud, but they had lost the confidence
of some of their outstanding men of action. The time
was swiftly approaching when the rankling stigma of
Uhud would be blotted out, when the Prophet would
take a final and complete revenge on his life-long
enemies, and when the Meccans would treat Allah with
an even more touching reverence than they already
bestowed upon Al-Ozza, Hubal, the Kaba and the
Black Stone.</p>


<h3 title="Section 2">II</h3>

<p>A serious reverse suffered by the army of Islam postponed
the inevitable surrender of Mecca for a year.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[p. 217]</span>
One of Mohammed’s emissaries, sent with a message
urging a certain Syrian leader to join Islam, had been
murdered by another Syrian chieftain; and the Prophet,
presumably ignorant that an attack on Syria was equivalent
to a declaration of war against the Roman Empire
itself, immediately sent a force of three thousand Moslems
to avenge the crime. As the soldiers departed,
he invoked this blessing on their errand: “The Lord
shield you from every evil, and bring you back in peace,
laden with spoil!” He then privately gave Zeid the
permission to make treaties in his own name, instead of
in the name of Mohammed himself, in order that the
covenants might the more readily be broken.</p>

<p>But once again Allah proved to be either absent-minded
or very inconsiderate. As the Moslem soldiers
neared the Dead Sea, they were amazed to learn that
an enormous army, skilled in Roman methods of battle,
was waiting to crush them. Conflicting counsels
were offered; many wished to instruct the Prophet of
this ill news and await his subsequent advice; but Abdallah
ibn Rawaha roused the wilting courage of his
fellows with these ringing words: “What have we
marched thus far but for this? Is it in our numbers,
or in the help of the Lord, that we put our trust?
Victory or the martyr’s crown, one or other, is secure.
<em>Then forward!</em>” His maniacal frenzy was imparted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[p. 218]</span>
his companions, who, meeting the powerful Roman
phalanx at Muta close to the Red Sea, madly threw
themselves upon the foe. Mohammed’s life-long
friend Zeid, who had most unwillingly relinquished
Zeinab in favor of the Prophet, bravely bore the white
Moslem banner until he willingly relinquished his life
for Islam. Jafar, another Moslem hero, then seized
the inspiring piece of cloth and, shouting out: “Paradise!
O Paradise! how fair a resting-place! Cold is
the water there, and sweet the shade,” was shortly able
to test the truth of his pæan. Abdallah ibn Rawaha
then fell in turn, bearing the flag to the ground with
him; at this moment Khalid demonstrated the genuineness
of his recent conversion by rallying the terrorized
Moslems and immediately speeding toward Medina
with the fragments of the army.</p>

<p>The Medinese, deeply dismayed at the rout, found
some relief by hurling dust and jeering taunts at the
truants; but Mohammed put a stop to their meanness
in this fashion: “Nay, these are not runaways; they
are men who will yet again return to battle, if the Lord
will.” Struck to the heart by the loss of so many tried
companions, he first went to Jafar’s house, where, clasping
the dead man’s children in his arms, he sobbed bitterly;
departing thence to the home of Zeid, he broke
down completely when Zeid’s little daughter threw herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[p. 219]</span>
tearfully into his arms. “Why thus, O Prophet?”
asked one person, who inconveniently recalled Mohammed’s
many injunctions that Moslems should not display
their sorrow at the times of death. “This is not
forbidden grief,” was the response, “it is but the fond
yearning in the heart of friend for friend.” Yet next
morning, as he worshiped in the Mosque, he smiled and
remarked: “That which ye saw in me yesterday was
because of sorrow for the slaughter of my Companions,
until I saw them in Paradise, seated as brethren, opposite
one another, upon couches. And in some I perceived
marks, as it were wounds of the sword. And I
saw Jafar as an angel with two wings, covered with
blood&mdash;his limbs stained therewith.”</p>

<p>Though smiles wreathed his face, a mordant desire
for vengeance gnawed at his heart. What a tragedy
that the Syrian tribes, who of late had been deeply impressed
by the conquest of Kheibar, should have learnt
that Islam, after all, was not invulnerable! Amr, the
recent Meccan turncoat, was accordingly placed in command
of a Moslem expedition to Syria, where his strong
right arm succeeded in restoring the Prophet’s weakened
prestige; yet the setback at Muta still rankled in
the minds of the Medinese, and Mohammed was probably
keen enough to realize that the situation could be
remedied only by the achievement of some extraordinary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[p. 220]</span>
astounding, unparalleled coup. No longer
would he insist that defeats were moral victories; no
longer would he indite Suras that placed the burden of
defeat squarely upon Allah’s broad shoulders; no
longer would he seek advice from Abu Bekr or his other
intimate counselors in martial concerns. Mecca,
Mecca! <em>There</em> lay the answer to all the questions that
vexed his dreams. All that was needed to justify the
taking the holy city was some specious pretext. So, at
any rate, certain historians argue and they may well be
right; yet Mohammed was driven by such intricate and
inexplorable motives that one does well to hesitate before
placing his finger on this or that spot in his journey
and saying, “Such and such an idea impelled him to act
thus at this particular point.” It is conceivable, for
example, that, by a mental process not wholly unfamiliar
to moderns, he may have been influenced in his
subsequent action by the belief&mdash;natural enough, surely,
for an Arab!&mdash;that Mecca was Allah’s own country.</p>

<p>In any event, a reason for attacking Mecca was soon
found. The Khozaa, a tribe in the neighborhood of
the sacred city, had chosen under the provisions of the
treaty between Islam and Mecca to join the Moslem
cause; another adjacent clan, the Beni Bekr, that contrariwise
had gone over to the Koreish, had proceeded,
with the assistance of some disguised Koreishites, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[p. 221]</span>
attack the Khozaa who of course hurried to Mohammed
for redress. Here, at last, was the long deferred opportunity.
The spokesmen of Khozaa had barely finished
the tale of their wrongs when the happy Prophet,
who was only half clothed, bounded to his feet and made
this fervent promise: “If I help you not in like wise
as if the wrong were mine own, then let me never more
be helped by the Lord! See ye not yonder cloud? As
the rain now poureth from it, even so shall help descend
upon you speedily from above.” When the Koreish
heard of this affair, their perturbation was so great that
they dispatched Abu Sufyan to see if it were possible
to obtain a renewal and extension of the treaty; but
Abu, the diplomat, turned out to be no more successful
than Abu, the general. Upon arriving at Medina, he
went straight to his daughter, Um Habiba, wife of the
Prophet; but, as he started to seat himself on her carpet,
she drew it away from him. “My daughter!” he
remonstrated, “whether is it that thou thinkest the carpet
is too good for me, or that I am too good for the
carpet?” “Nay, but it is the carpet of the Prophet,
and I choose not that thou, an impure idolator, shouldst
sit upon the Prophet’s carpet,” she coldly answered.
“Truly, my daughter, thou art changed for the worse
since thou leftest me,” Abu sighed; then, stepping out
of doors in front of the Mosque, he loudly cried:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[p. 222]</span>
“Hearken unto me, ye people! Peace and protection
I guarantee for all.” Mohammed, who was standing
near by, thereupon interrupted to remark, “It is thou
that sayest this, not we, O Abu Sufyan!” At this point
Abu decided that it was time for him to return home.</p>

<p>Mohammed rapidly and secretly laid his plans. He
requested many allied tribes to join with him, meanwhile
withholding his ulterior intentions from them;
and not until the very moment of the departure did he
enlighten the Medinese&mdash;at which time he also warned
them, by this prayer, to keep the secret from the Koreish:
“O Lord! Let not any spy carry tidings to
Koreish; blind their eyes and take their sight away
until I come suddenly upon them and seize them unawares!”
On January 1, 630, the largest Moslem army
ever collected thus far&mdash;with the additions of the desert
allies, it numbered close to ten thousand&mdash;set out for
Mecca. Al-Abbas, the shifty time-server, who had
assisted his nephew-Prophet in his escape from Mecca
ten years earlier only to be compelled to pay a large
ransom for himself after Bedr, now decided once and
for all that it would be highly advisable to espouse the
Moslem cause; so he slipped out of Mecca on the sly
and, approaching the Prophet, was much gratified upon
being welcomed with outstretched arms.</p>

<p>Mecca, however, was destined to be saved from violent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[p. 223]</span>
assault, though the precise reason for this happy
conclusion is not known. Concerning the event that
follows, it is not clear whether Abu Sufyan acted for
himself alone, or at the bidding of his Koreishite companions.
One night, as ten thousand Moslem campfires
illuminated the heavens from the hills that encircled
Mecca, Abu Sufyan came gliding toward the
tent of Mohammed, where he was commanded to remain
away until morning. Returning at that time, he
was thus accosted by the Prophet: “Out upon thee,
Abu Sufyan! hast thou not yet discovered that there
is no God but the Lord alone?” “Noble and generous
Sire! Had there been any God beside, verily he had
been of some avail to me,” whined Abu. “And dost
thou not acknowledge that I am the Prophet of the
Lord?” catechized Mohammed. “Noble Sire! As to
this thing, there is yet in my heart some hesitancy,” replied
the trembling but truthful fellow, who probably
found it difficult to look upon his own son-in-law as the
direct agent of God. At this moment Al-Abbas boldly
intruded with these well-chosen words: “Woe is thee!
it is no time for hesitancy, this. Believe and testify
forthwith the creed of Islam, or else thy neck shall be
in danger!” Then Abu diplomatically capitulated,
and vehemently proclaimed that he did indeed believe
there was no God but the Lord alone and that Mohammed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[p. 224]</span>
was His Prophet; and Mohammed, who had scored
what was probably the greatest individual triumph of
his career, joyfully exclaimed: “Haste thee to Mecca!
haste thee to the city; no one that taketh refuge in the
house of Abu Sufyan shall be harmed this day. And
hearken! speak unto the people, that whosoever closeth
the door of his house, the inmates thereof shall be in
safety.” Then, closely escorted by Al-Abbas, Abu
went forth, pausing a moment, as his amazed eyes swept
the innumerable warriors around him, to remark,
“Truly this kingdom of thy nephew’s is a mighty kingdom.”
“Nay, Abu Sufyan!” chided Al-Abbas, “he is
more than a king&mdash;he is a mighty Prophet!” “Yes,
thou sayest truly; now let me go,” replied Abu as he
edged away. Arriving home, he promptly repeated the
Prophet’s message; and never before, in all her long and
distinguished history, had Mecca witnessed such a
scurrying of feet and banging&mdash;or draping&mdash;of doors
as followed.</p>

<p>When the Moslem and allied hosts came victoriously
parading through the deserted streets, only one conflict
occurred. The impetuous Khalid, whose force was
greeted by a flight of arrows from a small band of
bitter-enders, was so delighted at his unexpected good
fortune that he followed up the assault until twenty-eight
of the foolhardy fugitives had been slain. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[p. 225]</span>
Prophet, standing on an eminence, was surveying with
sparkling eyes the fair scene stretched out before him
when he chanced to see this sporadic fray. “What!
did I not strictly command that there should be no
fighting?” he shouted in his anger; but when Khalid’s
just grievance was made clear, he calmed down and
commented, “That which the Lord decreeth is the best.”
Then, descending into the city on Al-Kaswa’s back, he
once more touched the Black Stone politely with his
staff and urged the patient camel seven times around
the Kaba. Pointing at the idols which surrounded its
walls, he ordered that they should at once be overthrown&mdash;indeed,
tradition affirms that, as he aimed his
staff at each image, it immediately tumbled down on
its face&mdash;and shouted out one passage that he happened
to remember from the Koran: “Truth hath
come, and falsehood gone; for falsehood verily vanisheth
away.” He next entered the holy edifice, devoutly
prostrated himself, and then stood watching with delighted
eyes the labors of Omar, who, by means of a
cloth wetted in Zemzem, rubbed out the pictures of such
idols as had been painted on the walls. Then Mohammed
gave back the key of the temple to its hereditary
guardian, and, turning to Al-Abbas, thus addressed
him: “And thou Al-Abbas, I confirm thee in the giving
drink from out of the well Zemzem to the pilgrims;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[p. 226]</span>
it is no mean office this that I give now unto thee”; and
nevermore did the already opulent double-dealer entertain
the least doubt as to the justice of his nephew’s
cause. Bilal, commanded by the Prophet, immediately
ascended the Kaba and sounded the call to prayer;
the subservient multitude knelt and worshiped, though
a few among them could not refrain from expressing,
in very subdued tones, their disgust at being obliged to
obey a negro slave. The Prophet next issued this
proclamation: “Whoever believeth in God, and in the
day of Judgment, let him not leave in his house any
image whatever that he doth not break in pieces.”
Now, since the Arabians in general cherished the belief
that a capable god should be able to defend himself,
the easy demolition of the deities in the Kaba had
convinced the Meccans that their gods&mdash;even Al-Ozza
and Hubal&mdash;were as useless as so many dolls. And so,
while the destruction of the helpless icons was enthusiastically
carried out in every Meccan home&mdash;while Abu
Sufyan’s wife, Hind, smashed her favorite god as energetically
as she had once ripped Hamza’s vitals out,
and further insulted the deity by the charge that it
had vilely cheated her all her life&mdash;Mohammed, fatigued
and dusty, retired to a corner of his tent and,
as his daughter, Fatima, shielded him with a screen,
gave himself a thorough bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[p. 227]</span></p>

<p>It is more than probable that the Koreish were immensely
relieved and pleased with the quiet and almost
bloodless subjugation of their city. In truth, although
some of them became sycophants who cringed
and fawned in order to win Mohammed’s good will,
the majority doubtless took pride in the fact that their
prodigal son, whose magnetic name was beginning to
cause apprehension even beyond the borders of Arabia,
had returned to demand his fatted calf. Their slumbers
need never more be broken by nightmares of his
precipitate assault upon them; further, the tiresome
burden of ruling, or trying to rule, for the welfare of
Mecca was now transferred to his gracious and omnipotent
hand. As a religious but non-political capital,
moreover, Mecca would be secure from whatever might
betide in the shifting destinies of time. And they were
right. Mohammed had won so easily, he had reached
such an unapproachable eminence, that he could afford&mdash;it
matters little whether from scrupulous policy
or wholly unselfish generosity&mdash;to be magnanimous.
If he directed the death of four ingrate Meccans, he
proclaimed a general amnesty for all the rest; if he
cast out idolatry, he substituted a religious ritualism
which coalesced the leading dogmas of the various Meccan
sects; and if he temporarily ruined Meccan commerce
by his famously unscientific monkeying with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[p. 228]</span>
calculation of time&mdash;inasmuch as the pilgrimage months
no longer always coincided with the period when caravan
trade flourished&mdash;he bountifully blessed her with
a permanent revenue that, after thirteen hundred years,
still continues to pour into her coffers. For, as Islam
has continued to prosper, all devout Moslems have at
one time or another journeyed from every quarter of
the globe to visit that “Navel of the Islamic faith”
which seems to them to be the earthly replica of that
indescribably glorious Paradise which awaits the faithful;
and myriads of curious, and even irreverent, sightseers
have perennially flocked thither to enjoy the endless
diversion afforded by one of the greatest religious
entertainments on the globe.</p>

<h3 title="Section 1">I</h3>

<p class="firstpara">The time rapidly approached when the Prophet was
to renounce the multitudinous burdens and joys of his
earthly existence, and depart to that supernal haven
which he had so frequently and so eloquently depicted.
For Allah, who had not gazed upon his faithful servant
since the episode of the midnight journey, yearned to
clasp him forever to his breast; and Mohammed believed
that Khadija, the Virgin Mary, Potiphar’s wife,
and Kulthum, sister of Moses, longingly anticipated his
arrival; so too, though for very different reasons, did
Gabriel, who desired a respite from his enervating trips
between Paradise and Medina. But a few months more
were yet to be granted Mohammed&mdash;months that were
to exemplify the same indomitable energy, the same
assiduous zealotry, that he had manifested for the last
twenty years.</p>

<p>Mecca was now irrevocably sealed to Islam; but that
very fact caused fearful apprehension among those Bedouin
peoples who were yet idolistic and untamed. The
powerful Hawazin and Beni Thakif tribes, who occupied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[p. 230]</span>
an extensive territory southeast of Mecca, decided
that they had a fair chance to crush the arrogant
dominion of this would-be conqueror of all Arabia while
he was yet rejoicing in his easy conquest of the holy
city; and to that end they assembled about six thousand
men. Mohammed, on learning of their plans, determined
to nip this insurrection in the bud, and quickly
departed at the head of twelve thousand seasoned
troops; so imposingly spectacular was this great force
that Abu Bekr could not restrain his admiration. “We
shall not this day be worsted by reason of the smallness
of our numbers!” he gleefully shouted, and the Prophet
smiled in agreement. Then, seated on a white mule,
he followed in the rear of the soldiers.</p>

<p>As the Moslem troops were defiling through a narrow
pass in the valley of Honein, the ambushed foe suddenly
charged upon them with such impetuosity that
they first hesitated, then recoiled and fled in utter panic.
“Whither away?” shouted Mohammed, while the broken
columns sped by him. “The Prophet of the Lord is
here! Return! return!” But his lungs were unequal
to the emergency, so he bade Al-Abbas try the strength
of his voice; and his uncle used his stentorian oratory
to such good effect that it rose above the clamorous turmoil
of retreat. A number of the penitent fighters
came shamefacedly back, and, shouting out, “Ya Labbeik!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[p. 231]</span>
Here we are, ready at thy call!” stopped the
flight of the rest and turned to face the pursuing Bedouins.
Mohammed, gazing at the bloody spectacle
from the safety of an adjacent hill, was so overpowered
with warlike ardor that he screamed: “Now is the
furnace heated; I am the Prophet that lieth not; the
seed of Abd al-Muttalib!” Then, hurling a fistful of
gravel at the foe, he continued: “Ruin seize them!
I swear they are discomfited. By the Lord of the
Kaba, they yield! God hath cast fear into their hearts.”
The hard-won victory was indeed so complete that thousands
of prisoners, forty thousand sheep and goats, and
four thousand ounces of silver were seized as spoil.
And the Prophet, repenting of his self-confidence before
the battle, indited a Sura which stated that the
preliminary defeat had been caused by over-confidence
in numbers, and that success had come only because
God “sent down Hosts which ye saw not, and thereby
punished the Unbelievers.”</p>

<p>Yet he realized that, in order to clinch the victory, it
would be imperative to capture the Bedouin stronghold
at At-Taif. In assaulting that place he trusted,
in addition to the heavenly hosts, to the most modern
Byzantine inventions of warfare&mdash;the testudo and the
catapult. But they both proved to be ineffective, for
the simple reason that the besieged garrison destroyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[p. 232]</span>
the wooden testudo by hurling molten metal upon it,
thus making it impossible to use the catapult at all.
As the weary weeks dragged on, Mohammed endeavored
to expedite the surrender of the fort by destroying
the vineyards around At-Taif and offering freedom to
any slaves who would desert the stronghold; but even
these traditional devices proved to be useless, and,
warned by a dream that the heavenly will was not in
favor of continuing the siege, he decided to accept the
counsels of his assistants, who were also getting very
tired of the business. The Prophet then withdrew to
the place where the booty won at Honein had been
stored.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the worldly wise members of
the Hawazin, having had plenty of time to reflect upon
the matter, had decided that by embracing Islam they
might get off with a lesser punishment than would otherwise
be the case. Mohammed, of course, was much
pleased to welcome them to the faith; but when they
suggested that, inasmuch as they were now loyal Moslems,
both their property and their prisoners should be
returned to them, he was wholly unable to concur. Instead,
he gave them this choice: “Whether of the two,
your families or your property, is the dearer to you?”
Impaled on the horns of this dilemma, they were forced
to admit that their relatives were more precious, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[p. 233]</span>
the prisoners were accordingly set free. The Prophet
was so much pleased by the possibilities of this barter
and trade in the name of Islam that he offered one
hundred camels to Malik, chief of the Hawazin, if he
too would embrace the Moslem cause; and Malik, being
a wise and prudent man, speedily accepted the
terms. But some of the other people, fearing that
they were to lose the loot as well as the prisoners, rushed
up to Mohammed and, shouting aloud, “Distribute to
us the spoil, the camels and the flocks!” treated him
so roughly that his mantle was ripped from him, whereupon
he sought to save himself by backing against a
tree. “Return to me my mantle, O Man!” he cried,
“return the mantle; for I swear by the Lord that if the
sheep and the camels were as many as the trees of the
forest in number, I would divide them all amongst
you.” Since they still continued to press him, he held
up a hair and exclaimed: “Even to a hair like this,
I would keep back nought but the fifth; and even that,”
he hastily decided to add, “I will divide amongst you.”</p>

<p>Thus the mob was quieted and the Prophet soon made
good his word; in fact, so generous was he in dealing
presents out among his new auxiliaries that he sometimes
gave a double gift to those who insisted that they
deserved it. Spectacles such as these could not fail
to anger many of his veteran associates who had received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[p. 234]</span>
nothing at all; never before had they met with
such cavalier treatment as this. When one of them
made the direct charge that Mohammed was unfair,
he was met with the irate reply: “Out upon thee! If
justice and equity be not with me, where will ye find
them?” The Prophet furthermore stated that, so far
as the elder Moslems were concerned, faith was its own
reward&mdash;a saying which the Medinese, who had waxed
fat and rich on the plunder of so many conquests, found
very hard to swallow. They continued to show their
displeasure so long that Mohammed finally called them
together and spoke honeyed words. “Ye men of Medina,
it hath been reported to me that ye are disconcerted,
because I have given unto these Chiefs largesses,
and have given nothing unto you. Now speak unto
me. Did I not come unto you whilst ye were wandering,
and the Lord gave you the right direction? needy,
and He enriched you; at enmity among yourselves,
and He hath filled your hearts with love and unity?”
As murmurs of assent began to rise, he continued:
“Why are ye disturbed in mind because of the things
of this life wherewith I have sought to incline these men
unto the faith in which ye are already stablished? Are
ye not satisfied that others should have the flocks and
herds, while ye carry back with you the Prophet of the
Lord? Nay, I will never leave you. If all mankind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[p. 235]</span>
went one way, and the men of Medina another way,
verily I would go the way of the men of Medina. The
Lord be favorable unto them, and bless them, and their
sons and their sons’ sons for ever!” Then, weeping
until the tears streamed down their manly beards, his
confederates shouted in unison, “Yea, we are well satisfied,
O Prophet, with our lot!” However, lest any
doubt might remain in the minds of any, Allah Himself
speedily revealed that alms&mdash;for both taxes and
war-plunder were thus ingenuously disguised&mdash;were
intended, among other persons, “for them whose hearts
are to be gained over.... It is an ordinance from
God; and God is knowing and wise.” Thus, by timely
revelations, the faith of Islam was steadily increased;
the most devout Moslems, indeed, regarded the inexorable
duty of paying onerous financial tributes to Allah
as an inestimable privilege; though it is true that a few
hard-hearted wretches publicly proclaimed that each
successive addition to the Koran furnished them new
cause for amusement.</p>


<h3 title="Section 2">II</h3>

<p>Honein was the last of a series of victories that laid
the Koreishite ghost forever; the Prophet was now virtually
the ruler of the entire Arabian peninsula; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[p. 236]</span>
having made a triumphant entrance into Medina, he
proceeded to execute a project that had long been dear
to his heart. As early as the year 627, he had sent out
feelers to a branch of the empire of Byzantium on the
subject of conversion to Islam; his envoy on that occasion,
though courteously welcomed and given a special
dress of honor, had accomplished little. But now, while
embassies from numerous Arabian tribes made haste
to present themselves to him, hoping to make a good
bargain by trading their recreant idols for the all-conquering
Allah, Mohammed’s apparently chimerical
fancy to extend Islam in, and even beyond, the bounds
of the Roman Empire was again aroused. The lonely
visionary of Mount Hira, the Meccan outcast, risen
to the imperial position of temporal and spiritual dictator
of all Arabia, vibrated with the insatiable desire
to make Islam dominant over the world. <em>He</em> might
not live to see that glorious fulfilment; yet perhaps his
notorious gift of prophecy enabled him to pierce the
veil that shadowed the future: the advance of Islam
under successive Caliphates until its haughty realm extended
from India to the western limits of Spain&mdash;the
stemming of the onrushing Saracen tide by Charles
Martel at Tours&mdash;the wayfaring Crusaders bent
upon rescuing the Holy Land from Mohammedan dominion&mdash;the
revival of interest in classic lore which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[p. 237]</span>
the direct result of the Crusades&mdash;the concomitant Renaissance
of learning and of Christianity until Christian
warriors, with a Bible in one hand and a sword in the
other, supplanted the imperial Crescent with the even
more imperial Cross&mdash;the Cross that has itself become
associated with imperialism. Thus, by a grotesque
chain of closely linked events, Mohammed might&mdash;had
his prophetic eye been gifted with sufficient range&mdash;have
envisaged himself in the odd position of being the
chief instrument in the world-wide promulgation of
classicism and of Christianity. For, had the Middle
Age Crusaders not been inspired with unremitting zeal
to wrest the Holy Grail from Islam, there might well
have been no Renaissance, no stimulation of mental and
spiritual activities, and, consequently, no such Christian
imperialism as now holds so much of the world under
its righteous sway.</p>

<p>Had Mohammed foreseen all this, however, he might
possibly have had less interest in those embassies to and
from his house in the Mosque, where, sprawling on his
mat and cooling his face with a palm-leaf fan, he issued
his endless commands and listened to endless requests
from suppliants. Indeed, his office work had become
so voluminous that he now made use of an amanuensis,
Zeid the son of Thabit, who was specially skilled in the
Hebrew and Syriac languages. Though quick-witted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[p. 238]</span>
and agile of tongue, Zeid was inclined to be so forgetful
and generally scatter-brained that the Prophet was
obliged to tell him to thrust his pen behind his ear, “for
this will bring to remembrance that which the distracted
mind is seeking after.”</p>

<p>If tradition may be trusted, Mohammed was not always
over-successful in his dealings with prospective
converts. The Christian tribe of Nejran, in central
Arabia, came to him after an ostentatious exhibition of
prayer in the Mosque, and loudly declared that they
were Moslems; but the Prophet, observing that they
wore silk-lined clothes&mdash;which he particularly detested,
though it is true that he ordered such hapless Moslems
as became afflicted with the itch or “louse-disease” to
wear silken shirts&mdash;rightly doubted their sincerity and
merely turned up his nose at them; they therefore departed
and shortly returned in monastic garb. Their
leader, doubtless inspired with the hope that a display
of knowledge on his part would gain them better terms,
offered to debate with Mohammed concerning the mystical
nature of Christ, but he wisely declined to comply
and stated that he would prefer to engage in a cursing
contest; and in fact, while one of his most uncritical
admirers affirmed that the worst oath he ever used
was “May his forehead be darkened with mud!” the
Koran, among other authentic documents, furnishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[p. 239]</span>
considerable evidence to the contrary. Realizing that
they would be no match for him in such an ordeal, the
Nejranites capitulated to the extent of agreeing to pay
tribute, though they refused to acknowledge his divine
mission; the Prophet acceded to this compromise, but
soothed his ruffled dignity by declaring that they were
one of the two worst tribes in all Arabia, and by announcing
that Christians, as well as Jews, were to act
as substitutes for Moslems in Hell-fire. Moreover, believing
that Christianity and Judaism were both on their
last legs, he devised the humane stipulation that, provided
Christians and Hebrews submitted to the earthly
rule of Islam and paid “tribute with their hands,” they
would be permitted to profess whatever faith they chose.
Yet he would presumably have been better pleased had
all Arabians manifested the delicate concern shown by
a fellow named Al-Jarud. “O Prophet,” said he, “I
have hitherto followed the Christian faith, and I am
now called on to change it. Wilt thou be <em>Surety</em> for
me in the matter of my religion?” “Yea, I am thy
surety that God hath guided thee to a better faith than
it,” Mohammed gladly answered.</p>

<p>Two dispatches were probably sent to Heraclius,
Emperor of Byzantium, who had just completed a victorious
struggle with Persia. The first one, which requested
him to cease the idolatrous worship of Jesus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[p. 240]</span>
and His Mother, to reverence the one true God, and to
recognize the mission of Mohammed, was apparently
disregarded; a second message, couched in like terms,
prompted a vassal of Heraclius to request permission to
punish the insolent pretender who sent it, but Heraclius
forbade any needless expedition against the contemptible
person who had audaciously signed himself “Mohammed
the Apostle of God.” The King of Persia,
on receiving a similar note, merely tore it up; and the
Prophet, on hearing of this outrage, prayed aloud:
“Even thus, O Lord! rend thou his kingdom from
him!” It may be presumed that neither Heraclius nor
the Persian King even suspected that, within a decade
or two, their mighty empires would be paying tribute
to Islam. A letter that Mohammed sent to Ruayyah,
of Suhaim, was treated more respectfully than the one
that had been dispatched to the Persian monarch; for
Ruayyah used it to mend a hole in his water-skin. Another
powerful chief, having listened to Mohammed’s
delegate, instructed him to carry back this message:
“How excellent is that Revelation to which thou invitest
me, and how beautiful! Know that I am the
Poet of my tribe, and an Orator. The Arabs revere
my dignity. Grant unto me, therefore, a share in the
rule, and I will follow thee.” The Prophet, on being
informed of this, snarled: “Had this man asked of me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[p. 241]</span>
but an unripe date, as his share in the land, I would
not have given it. Let him perish, and his vainglory
with him!”&mdash;and it is confidently stated that the presumptuous
snob did, in fact, die within a year. The
Roman Governor of Egypt, too, refused to endorse Mohammed’s
claims&mdash;“I am aware,” he said, “that a
prophet is yet to arise; but I am of opinion that he will
appear in Syria”&mdash;yet he atoned for his stubbornness
of heart by sending Mohammed a double present in the
form of a white mule and a black concubine.</p>

<p>Mohammed, meanwhile, was showing his interest in
his recent converts by altering their Pagan names to
titles that better suited his almost feminine fondness for
daintily euphemistic words. For example, “Zeid of the
Stud” right gladly abandoned his plebeian appellation
when he was rechristened “Zeid of the Good”; “the
Wolf, son of the Cub,” was similarly glorified by becoming
“Allah’s Servant”; and an “Oppressor” suffered
a welcome sea-change into a “Well-doer.” But
when a tribe called the “Sons of Bastardy” were politely
accosted as the “Sons of Chastity,” they announced
their steadfast desire to remain true to their ancient heritage.</p>

<p>Nor did Mohammed’s reforms stop here. The Koran
had already prohibited the use of wine; for, years
earlier, the Prophet, while attempting to chide his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[p. 242]</span>
uncle, Hamza, who was riotously drunk, had received
the tipsy response, “Are you not my father’s slave?”
Liquor, therefore, had been proscribed as a foe to Islam
and the dignity of the prophetic office; this rule was so
rigorously enforced, in truth, that even a hero of Bedr
had been beaten again and again for perennial intoxication,
and on one occasion Mohammed himself hurled
clods of dirt at another offender. Gambling, too&mdash;the
casting of lots and the “arrow-game,” in which camels
were the prizes&mdash;had been divinely banned as abominations
“from amongst the works of Satan.” Mohammed’s
acutely sensitive nature now led him to proscribe
anything that savored of torture inflicted on animals:
living birds might not be used as targets in shooting
contests; camels were not to be tied up and left to die
on their owners’ graves; cattle were not to be blinded
to avert the evil eye; droughts were not to be broken by
the common process of affixing flaming torches to the
tails of cattle; horses were not to lose their manes and
tails, and asses were no longer to be branded or hit in the
face. So scrupulously fastidious was the Prophet that
he once ordered some Moslems to stop burning an ant-hill,
and he also strongly disapproved the ubiquitous
practice of cursing camels and cocks.</p>

<p>His humanity and foresight were also manifested in
more important matters. Blood-feuds&mdash;the time-honored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[p. 243]</span>
and almost ineradicable system of tribal revenge
for homicide&mdash;he endeavored, with partial success,
to wipe out by emphasizing the brotherhood of
Islam, and by advocating the acceptance of money as a
partial compensation: ethical and legislative essays that
gradually led to a saner and more peaceful system of
government. Whatever may be thought of his general
attitude toward women, he certainly benefited them
incalculably by setting up laws that enabled them
to inherit and hold property; and the luridly overemphasized
harem system, Pagan though it may be,
has some virtues that are perhaps absent from the
Occidental system of prostitution. His advocacy of
the custom by which the wives of captives automatically
became the concubines of Moslem conquerors has especially
irritated certain modern moralists, who apparently
have not reflected very deeply on certain canons of contemporary
conduct, in which wealth and social distinction
play the rôle of the victorious Islamites. He accepted
slavery as a matter of course&mdash;and, indeed, Islam
has never indulged in any foolish civil strife over
the question of bondage&mdash;but he insisted that slaves
must be treated with the utmost kindness. Men who
beat their slaves were placed by him among the lowest
of the low; he stated that manumission was a pious
act, and he sometimes let offenders off from any punishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[p. 244]</span>
when they agreed to free their serfs&mdash;in short,
the present industrial system has little to boast of in
comparison with Mohammed’s attitude toward serfdom.
One other inhuman custom&mdash;the ancient practice of female
infanticide&mdash;was summarily abolished by him; and
a tale survives that well illustrates the horror he felt
concerning such deeds. Two men, about to yield themselves
to the claims of Islam, chanced to question the
Prophet about his views on child-murder. “Our mother
Muleika was full of good deeds and charity; but she
buried a little daughter alive. What is her condition
now?” they inquired. “The burier and the buried both
in hell,” replied Mohammed, upon which his guests became
very angry and started to leave. “Come back,”
he requested, “mine own mother, too, is there with
yours.” But even this inducement failed to convince
them, and so they returned into the outer darkness.</p>


<h3 title="Section 3">III</h3>

<p>Old age, meanwhile, crept gently though inexorably
upon the Prophet; but its stealthy approach seemed
only to quicken the strength of his arm and the matchless
fertility of his intellect. His groveling acolytes,
completely bewitched by the magical power of his colossal
personality, had exalted him to such a dazzling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[p. 245]</span>
deification that, had Allah Himself chosen to appear in
the streets of Medina, He might easily have passed
unnoticed amid the encomiums that were daily showered
upon His Apostle&mdash;or, rather, Allah might carelessly
have been classified with the famous Three Pretenders
who, by their conjuring tricks and fake miracles,
excited the wrathful amusement of the Prophet in
the last year of his earthly life. In fact, it has been
pointed out as a matter for deep regret that, while the
Koran allows Allah only ninety-nine separate and distinct
appellations, His Prophet, at the zenith of his
career, was addressed by no fewer than two hundred
and one individual titles, including a round score of
those that had been applied to Allah Himself.</p>

<p>In the autumn of the year 630, Mohammed conducted
his final military expedition. Setting out at the head
of a Moslem army that seems to have totaled nearly
thirty thousand men, he planned to chastise a Byzantine
force that was reputed to have gathered on the
Syrian border near Tebuk; but when that place was
reached, it was found that there was no Byzantine or
any other force to be conquered. Mohammed, thus
finding himself in much the same position as the French
King in the doggerel ballad, proceeded to march home
again after exacting pledges of conversion and immense
booty from contingent tribes. His followers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[p. 246]</span>
who stated their belief that the “wars for religion now
are ended,” foolishly began to sell their weapons; but
the far-sighted Prophet sternly stopped them and uttered
the fateful remark: “There shall not cease from
the midst of my people a party engaged in fighting for
the truth, until Antichrist appear.” Scarcely had he
returned to Medina when his heart was gladdened by
two events: the death of his only important rival, Abdallah
ibn Obei&mdash;to whom the Prophet deemed it safe
and expedient to pay tribute by following his bier
and praying at his grave&mdash;and the surrender of At-Taif,
the single stronghold that had ever successfully defied
his might. He was so exhilarated by the downfall of
this fort, indeed, that he let its defenders off from the
necessity of breaking their own idols, and, in their stead,
elected two Moslems to perform the peculiarly pleasant
task.</p>

<p>But perhaps Mohammed most enjoyed the multitudinous
activities inherent in his position as a kind and
fatherly counselor of his people. The matters which
he was besought to adjudicate were extraordinary in
their range. One day his prayers would be requested
by some prospective bridegroom, who hoped, by the aid
of such divine sorcery, to win a wife of unusual goodness
and humility; next day he would be begged to specify
the precise hour when the world was destined to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[p. 247]</span>
end; another day would find him busily laying down
oracles governing the proper boiling of meat. Only
two types of interrogation were taboo: matters that
were wholly rational or wholly metaphysical; and Mohammed
probably barred these topics on the sensible
grounds that preceding prophets who had tampered
with either of them had almost uniformly come to grief.
Thus it came about that countless apothegms, whose
absolute authenticity can never be nicely determined,
were confidently claimed to be the children of his brain.
Yet, despite the fact that most of these sayings betray
a hard-headed and close-fisted sagacity, he was in debt
when he died; and perhaps, therefore, the stories concerning
his senile delight in the children of his body
deserve more credence. Sonless though he was, he
could partially console himself by playing with his
grandsons, Al-Hasan and Al-Hosein, the progeny of
Ali and Fatima, and by reflecting on the transcendent
heritage that awaited them as male descendants of himself.
In fact, legends sprang up that made a Moslem
holy family out of Mohammed, the two boys, and their
mother, Fatima, who was further honored by being entitled
“The Lady of Paradise”; but, unfortunately for
his beatific visions concerning Al-Hasan and Al-Hosein&mdash;who
frequently entertained themselves by clambering
upon their grandfather’s broad back while he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[p. 248]</span>
bowed in prayer&mdash;they turned out to be scurvy fellows
who excelled only in incompetence and cowardice.</p>

<p>It may be that Mohammed had a premonition of his
imminent death. He decided, at all events, to make a
“Farewell Pilgrimage” to Mecca in March, 632, so
that he might for the last time feast his eyes on that
sacred citadel and undergo the solemn rites of the
Greater Pilgrimage&mdash;a thing he had not done since the
Hegira. He first took a careful bath, then mounted
Al-Kaswa, and, accompanied by his entire harem and
one hundred votive camels, set forth on the long journey.
Having meticulously and painfully performed
the prescribed gyrations and genuflections, he cast some
small stones at the “Devil’s corner”&mdash;a spot near Mecca
where Abraham was reputed to have met and conquered
Satan&mdash;and concluded his toilsome duties by delivering
a notable speech. After making many additions to,
and revisions upon, the already numberless regulations
which he had been formulating for more than twenty
years, he concluded with these words: “Verily, I have
fulfilled my mission. I have left that amongst you&mdash;a
plain command, the Book of God, and manifest Ordinances&mdash;which,
if ye hold fast, ye shall never go astray.”
Then, turning his eyes heavenward, he exclaimed: “O
Lord! I have delivered my message and discharged
my Ministry.” “Yea,” came the deep-throated voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[p. 249]</span>
of the throng that hemmed him in, “yea, verily thou
hast.” “O Lord!” he continued, unmindful of the
pious interruption, “I beseech Thee bear Thou witness
unto it.” Returning straightway to Mecca, he encircled
the Kaba seven times; thence he went to Zemzem
and, having drunk part of the contents of a pitcher
filled with its holy water, he rinsed his mouth and asked
that the water still remaining in the vessel should be
poured back into the well. After abiding three more
days at Mecca, he departed from it forever and ambled
by easy stages back to Medina.</p>


<h3 title="Section 4">IV</h3>

<p>By this time the sinister tokens of physical decay, unavoidably
betrayed by the Prophet, filled everyone with
deepest concern. Abu Bekr observed him one day,
stroking his beard and looking intently at it; then Abu,
his eyes filling with sudden tears, broke out: “Ah, thou,
for whom I would sacrifice father and mother, white
hairs are hastening upon thee!” “Yes,” came the slow
response, “it is the travail of inspiration that hath done
this. The Suras Hud, and the Inevitable, and the
Striking, with their fellows, these have made white my
hair.” Yet when he actually became ill with pleurisy,
or some sort of fever, he named a definite source for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[p. 250]</span>
the malady: the poisoned mutton which Zeinab, the
Jewess, had fed him. “This, verily, is the effect of
that which I ate at Kheibar,” he declared. “The artery
in my back feeleth as though it would just now burst
asunder.” If his theory was correct, he doubtless died&mdash;as
his worshipers fervently claimed&mdash;the honorable
death of a martyr; but it seems probable that his illness
had some more tangible origin. Believing that water
could not be contaminated, he sometimes carelessly
drank from a cistern that was used for slops; as a medicine
man who had often attempted to cure his people
by charms, cauterization and cupping, he had submitted
himself to these practices so frequently that his system
must have been gradually weakened; furthermore,
Ayesha stated that his health had been poor for years,
and that she had constantly dosed him with a profusion
of odd concoctions which she herself compounded from
innumerable prescriptions recommended by sympathizing
friends.</p>

<p>It is not strange, therefore, that, shortly after he had
presented a banner to a Moslem army which he commanded
to march toward Syria on May 27, 632, for the
purpose of avenging the defeat at Muta, he found himself
curiously listless and weak. Late one subsequent
night, accompanied only by a servant, he stole out to
the cemetery on the edge of Medina. After a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[p. 251]</span>
and melancholy period of meditation, he thus apostrophized
the souls of the dead: “Verily, both ye and I
have received fulfilment of that which our Lord did
promise us. Blessed are ye! for your lot is better than
the lot of those that are left behind. Temptation and
trial approach like portions of a dark night that follow
one upon another, each darker than that preceding it.
O Lord! have mercy upon them that lie buried here!”
Next morning, as he passed Ayesha’s chamber, he heard
her calling out, “My head!&mdash;O, my head!” Entering,
he gently reproved her thus: “Nay, Ayesha, it is
rather I that have need to cry <cite>My head, my head!</cite> But
wouldst thou not,” he continued, in a feeble attempt to
be humorous, “desire to be taken whilst I am yet alive;
so that I might pray over thee, and wrapping thee,
Ayesha, in thy winding-sheet, myself commit thee to
the grave?” Then, in spite of her pain, she railed at
him. “Ah, that, I see, is what thou wishest for!
Truly, I can behold thee, when all was over, returning
straightway hither, and sporting with a new beauty in
my chamber here!” But, perceiving that he was really
ailing, she forgot her own headache and tenderly cared
for him.</p>

<p>Multitudes of conflicting stories have been handed
down concerning the happenings of the week that preceded
his dissolution; but, inasmuch as they emanated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[p. 252]</span>
from three distinct political groups, each of whom
wished to be recognized as the sole source of truth, the
precise occurrences of that fateful period will never
be accurately known. At the beginning of his illness
it appears certain that, on account of his predilection
for baths, he commanded his wives to drench him in cold
water on the intriguing theory that, since fever was
caused by sparks of Hell-fire, it could be summarily
squelched by water; but in this case the douche seems to
have had the unfortunate result of sending him into
convulsions. It is claimed that, during an interval of
temporary relief, he went forth and addressed his devotees
in the Mosque&mdash;a proceeding which, if it was true,
was presumably the reason for his consequent relapse.
By Saturday, June 6, his temperature is said to have
been so high that Omar, having placed his hand on the
tormented man’s forehead, quickly withdrew it with
the consoling exclamation, “O Prophet, how fierce is the
fever upon thee!” “Yea, verily,” Mohammed gasped,
“but I have been during the night season repeating in
praise of the Lord seventy Suras, and among them the
seven long ones”; and a moment later he added, “Just
as this affliction prevaileth now against me, even so shall
my reward hereafter be.” On Sunday he was delirious
much of the time and suffered such excruciating pain
that, following a consultation among his wives, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[p. 253]</span>
decided to administer physic; so they forced the drug
down his throat, but, notwithstanding his agony, he
readily recognized the too familiar noxious taste and
bitterly reproached them. When they admitted their
guilt, he cried: “Out upon you! this is a remedy for
pleurisy ... an evil disease is it which the Lord will
not let attack me. Now shall ye all of you within this
chamber partake of the same. Let not one remain
without being physiked, even as ye have physiked me,
excepting only my uncle, Al-Abbas.” The repentant
women immediately arose, and each obediently gave the
drug to the other until all had swallowed some of it;
and this strange scene around the Prophet’s deathbed
is one of the small number that are best authenticated.</p>

<p>Certain other tales may be accepted without too much
over-scrupulous demur. As he lay alternately drawing
the bed-clothes over his face and then tossing them off,
he would shriek out unconnected sentences: “The
Lord destroy the Jews and Christians!... O Lord,
let not my tomb be ever an object of worship!...
Verily the chiefest among you all for love and devotion
to me is Abu Bekr. If I were to choose a bosom
friend it would be he; but Islam hath made a closer
brotherhood amongst us.... O my soul! Why seekest
thou refuge elsewhere than in God alone?...
Fetch me hither pen and ink, that I may make for you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[p. 254]</span>
a writing which shall hinder you from going astray for
ever.” On Monday he seemed a little better, but it
was only the final flicker of the dying candle. Toward
midday, as Ayesha sat holding his head tenderly on
her bosom “between her lungs and her neck,” she noticed
that his wandering eye had fixed upon a green
toothpick; and, after chewing it so that it might be
more pliable, she offered it to the dying man who used
it for a moment with all his old vigor. But he soon
began to sink rapidly, and, as though realizing the imminence
of death, he called aloud: “O Lord, I beseech
thee assist me in the agonies of death!” Then, while
he spasmodically blew breath over his burning body,
he thrice repeated, “Gabriel, come close unto me!” It
is a regrettable fact that the interesting question of his
final utterance must forever remain undecided. One
authority declares that he expressed a wish to have
concubines treated with consideration; but it is perhaps
more appropriate to accept the story that, as consciousness
slowly departed, he gently breathed: “Lord,
grant me pardon; and join me to the blessed companionship
on high. Eternity in Paradise!... Pardon!...
The blessed companionship on high!...”&mdash;his
head fell lower, a cold drop of moisture trickled down
upon Ayesha’s breast, and all was over.</p>

<p>Yet no one, not even Ayesha, could believe it for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[p. 255]</span>
time. Thinking that he had only fainted, she called
aloud for help; and Omar, who immediately came in,
looked lovingly upon the familiar and still lifelike features
and exclaimed: “The Prophet is not dead; he
hath but swooned away.” But Abu Bekr, who was
welcomed into the sacred adytum with the feminine salutation,
“Come, for this day no permission needeth to be
asked,” at once realized the awful truth, which he cautiously
made known by stooping and kissing his master’s
face, and saying: “Sweet wast thou in life, and
sweet thou art in death. Yes, thou <em>art</em> dead! Alas,
my friend, my chosen one!” After kissing the face a
second time, he covered it with a striped cloth and
gently withdrew from the room, while Mohammed’s
wives beat their faces, uttered loud and plaintive ululations,
“and there arose a wailing of celestial voices.”
The corpse was washed and laid out, and, in addition
to the garment which he wore at the time of his death,
two sheets of costly white linen were wrapped around
it. After some discussion, it was decided on the advice
of Islam’s new leader, Abu Bekr&mdash;“I have heard it
from the lips of Mohammed himself,” he announced,
“that in whatsoever spot a prophet dieth, there also
should he be buried”&mdash;that a deep grave should be excavated
beneath the apartment of Ayesha. During the
night the ominous thud of pickaxes disturbed the troubled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[p. 256]</span>
dreams of the Prophet’s widows&mdash;“I did not believe
that Mohammed was really dead,” confessed Um
Selama, “till I heard the sound of the pickaxes at the
digging of the grave, from the next room”&mdash;and next
day a constant stream of weeping Moslems filed by to
look for the last time upon the beloved face that now
resembled a sheet of withered parchment. That evening
the body was lowered into the grave, whose bottom
had been covered with the Prophet’s precious red
mantle; the gaping hole was built over with unbaked
bricks, plain earth was then shoveled upon the tomb,
and there, in the august simplicity of his domestic abode,
Mohammed’s form has ever since remained.</p>

<p>Meanwhile&mdash;since all things are possible with Allah&mdash;it
may surely be conjectured that Gabriel had abundantly
granted the Prophet’s dying request, and had
borne him, along the familiar route previously traversed
in the midnight journey from Jerusalem, for the second
and last time into the presence of his Maker. And
there&mdash;may not one hope?&mdash;at the zenith of the Seventh
Heaven, in that ravishing Paradise which so closely
resembles an infinitely idealized Arabian oasis, he abides
even unto this day and will continue to dwell “For ever
therein&mdash;a fair abode and resting place!”&mdash;enjoying
the ineffable entertainments that have been prepared
for the Moslem saints and martyrs who, triumphant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[p. 257]</span>
over sin and suffering, have been welcomed to the indepictable
felicities of the divine beatitudes; quaffing
deep draughts from those inexhaustible “rivers of wine”
which the Koran promises to those who have manfully
abstained from all earthly elixirs; continually cherished
by seventy dark-eyed, deep-bosomed Houris who, as
befits inhabitants of the “Garden of Delight,” individually
reside within the modest seclusion of enormous
hollow pearls; ever and anon chanting, through his
black-bearded lips, the ninety-nine beautiful names of
Allah, and concluding with the inevitable refrain, “<i lang="ar">La
ilaha illa Allah, Mohammed rasul Allah!</i>”</p>
